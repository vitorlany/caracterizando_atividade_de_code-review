The output of Java is also concerned.\r\n\r\nThere are two questions on the definition of array. \r\n1. malloc is not used to define an array in C++. But to free the space of the temporary array, I add an initializing way, but it is not smart.\r\n2. Since malloc cannot initialize the array, I initialized it by myself. I am wondering if calloc should be introduced to reader in this part.\r\n\r\nI hope the reviewer could give some advice. \r\n\r\n\r\n> Tip: If this PR is not related to the coding or code translation, please ignore the checklist.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I've tested the code and ensured the outputs are the same as the outputs of reference codes.\r\n- [x] I've checked the codes (formatting, comments, indentation, file header, etc) carefully.\r\n- [x] The code does not rely on a particular environment or IDE and can be executed on a standard system (Win, macOS, Ubuntu).\r\n",

In order to improve readability, I have adopted the following approach and implemented the `min` function: `min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + cost[i]`.\r\n\r\n- For the `minCostClimbingStairsDPComp` function, the modification is the same as above.\r\n",
