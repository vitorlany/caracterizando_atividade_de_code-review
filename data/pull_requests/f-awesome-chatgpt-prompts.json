We can construct such a formula by negating one of the atomic propositions in $\\Gamma_t^n$, i.e. $\\psi' = \\neg p_i$ for some $1 \\leq i \\leq n$. Since $v \\vDash \\Gamma_t^n$, we know that $v(p_i) = 1$. Therefore, $v(\\neg p_i) = 0$, and $v \\nvDash \\psi'$.\r\n\r\nNext, we show that $\\Gamma^{n+1} = \\Gamma_t^n \\cup {\\psi'}$ is a minimal-unsatisfying formulae set. This means that there is no proper subset of $\\Gamma^{n+1}$ that is satisfiable. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there exists a proper subset $\\Gamma' \\subset \\Gamma^{n+1}$ such that $v \\vDash \\Gamma'$. Since $\\Gamma'$ is a proper subset of $\\Gamma^{n+1}$, we know that $\\psi' \\notin \\Gamma'$. Therefore, $\\Gamma' \\subseteq \\Gamma_t^n$, and $v \\vDash \\Gamma_t^n$. However, this contradicts our assumption that $v \\nvDash \\psi'$, since $\\psi'$ is a formula that is not satisfied by $v$. Therefore, no proper subset of $\\Gamma^{n+1}$ is satisfiable, and $\\Gamma^{n+1}$ is a minimal-unsatisfying formulae set.\r\n\r\nSince we have shown that there exists a formula $\\psi'$ such that $v \\nvDash \\psi'$ and $\\Gamma^{n+1} = \\Gamma_t^n \\cup {\\psi'}$ is a minimal-unsatisfying formulae set, the claim holds for any $0 \\leq n$.\r\n\\end{proof}\r\n\r\nNote: The above proof uses the concepts of satisfying valuations and minimal-unsatisfying formulae sets in propositional logic. It may be helpful to have a basic understanding of these concepts before reading the proof.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59158336/214090729-56f7a4f6-3dc4-451e-861b-01e676da5d8c.PNG)\r\n\r\n# Add New Prompt\r\n\r\nYou'll need to add your prompt into README.md, and to the `prompts.csv` file.
