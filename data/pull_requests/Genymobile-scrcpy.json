Since we can't use most of these directly from Java (AFAIK), we need either native code or a library that allows us to call these functions. To avoid depending on the NDK, I'm using the Java Native Access library;\r\n- JNA requires a native library (libjnidispatch.so). For some reason, `app_process` doesn't want to load it, so right now it's extracted to `/data/local/tmp` on initialization and cleaned up later.\r\n\r\n## Things you can help with\r\n\r\n- Testing:\r\n    - Comment whether it works on your device or not, so I can keep a list;\r\n    - Axes behavior;\r\n    - Multiple controllers.\r\n- Find a way to use the `ioctl` syscall without native code;\r\n- Load native libraries without extracting them;\r\n- Figure out multiple controllers with event injection.\r\n\r\n## To-do\r\n\r\n- [x] Add command line option for disabling game controllers\r\n- [x] Write tests\r\n- [x] Isolate uinput related stuff into another class (so other types of devices can be implemented)\r\n- [x] Fix input not working when uinput fails\r\n- [x] Support legacy uinput\r\n- [x] Look into event injection (for when uinput is unavailable)\r\n- [ ] Look into getting games to recognize axis movement when using event injection\r\n- [ ] Implement controller through event injection\r\n\r\n## Out of scope\r\n\r\nI probably won't be adding some special features to this pull request, such as:\r\n- Vibration\r\n- Battery reporting\r\n- Lights\r\n- Touchpad\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\nIf you have any feedback (suggestions, complaints, new info, ...), please don't hesitate to write it down below.\r\n\r\n## Tested devices\r\n\r\nManufacturer | Model | Android version | Last tested on | Tested by | Supported | Supported with root\r\n:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:\r\nMotorola | Moto G<sup>5</sup> Plus | 8.1 | 2021-04-30 | @LHLaurini | :x: | :grey_question:\r\nMotorola | moto g(6) play | 9 | 2021-04-30 | @LHLaurini | :x: | :grey_question:\r\nSamsung | Galaxy A7 2018 | 10 | 2021-04-06 | @Fablo020 | :x: | :grey_question:\r\nSamsung | Galaxy M21s | 11 | 2021-04-30 | @LHLaurini | :heavy_check_mark: | :grey_question:\r\nHuawei | Honor Play COR-L29 | 9 | 2021-05-01 | @Cannahawk | :x: | :grey_question:\r\nXiaomi | Pocophone F1 | 11 | 2021-05-23 | @Nightm4res | :grey_question: | :heavy_check_mark:\r\nSony | Xperia XZ1 Compact | 11 | 2021-06-14 | @Schlumpf7 | :heavy_check_mark: | :grey_question:\r\nSony | Xperia XZ | :grey_question: | 2021-06-15 | @Schlumpf7 | :heavy_check_mark: | :grey_question:\r\nBlackview | BV6000 | :grey_question: | 2021-06-15 | @Schlumpf7 | :heavy_check_mark: | :grey_question:\r\nXiaomi | Mi A3 | 11 | 2021-06-17 | @RuiGuilherme | :heavy_check_mark: | :grey_question:\r\nNvidia | Shield TV | 11 | 2022-02-12 | @scaldav | :heavy_check_mark: | :grey_question:\r\nBlackview | BV6300 Pro | 10 | 2022-05-02 | @Fancy2209 | :heavy_check_mark: | :grey_question:\r\nGoogle | Pixel 6 | 12 | 2022-06-02 | @AntoninHuaut | :heavy_check_mark: | :grey_question:\r\nRedmi | Note 9 Pro 5G | 12 | 2022-06-18 | @esec | :heavy_check_mark: | :grey_question:\r\nRedmi | Note 5 Pro | 11[*](#issuecomment-1160959261 \"LineageOS 18\") | 2022-06-20 | @Sigmacringe | :heavy_check_mark: | :grey_question:\r\n\r\nThe list of (un)supported devices can change anytime.\r\n\r\n### Reporting a new device\r\n\r\nIf you have tested with a device not on the list, please report it by writing a comment below.

In this case, they are assigned based on my perceived difficulty in activating the feature using the mouse and how often used.\r\n\r\nGiven such, I decided that app switch to be the 4th button and notifications panel to be the 5th button.\r\nThese are what I believe to be the best use for these two. The 4th button being the app switch should be close to the no-brainer.\r\nAs for the notifications being the 5th, that one is more open for discussion. IMO, the major competitors being:\r\n\r\n1. Notifications panel\r\n2. Pinch-to-zoom\r\n3. paste\r\n\r\nNo more buttons are assigned because SDL doesn't support them. \r\nFor now, I would present this way, as a way to start a discussion",

This allows reusing existing AoA mouse/keyboard code to do the HID device emulation, and use native C code to handle UHID messages (which is also defined in C headers).\r\n\r\nThe new option is named `--keyboard-input-mode`, after its internal name. Available values are `disable`, `inject`, `aoa` and `uhid`. `aoa` deprecates the `-K`/`--hid-keyboard` option. When `--otg` is not specified, all values are accepted, except `aoa` doesn't work on Windows. When `--otg` is specified, only `disable` and `aoa` are accepted. When `--keyboard-input-mode` is not speficied, it defaults to `inject` in normal mode and `aoa` in OTG mode.\r\n\r\nThree new control messages are added: `UHID_OPEN`, `UHID_WRITE` and `UHID_CLOSE`. Each UHID device is a separate file descriptor, so all messages have an `int id` field, generated by client, maps to a file descriptor on server.\r\n\r\nCurrently `UHID_OPEN` and `UHID_WRITE` both have a `byte[] data` field (containing a `uhid_event` structure), so opening file and registering device can be done in one message. But this design is a little bit strange. Maybe we don't need `UHID_OPEN` at all.\r\n\r\nOne new device messages are added: `UHID_DATA`. It contains a `uhid_event` structure read from the file descriptor. In theory the client should wait for a `UHID_DATA` messages with `START` and `OPEN` UHID message types before starting to send inputs, but in practice these two arrives pretty quickly, so when user starts typing, UHID already finished initializing.\r\n\r\n`UHID_DATA` can also contain `OUTPUT` UHID messages, these are HID output reports defined in the device's report descriptor, for example LED status for keyboards and rumbles for gamepads. The code to handle these messages haven't been added to the client.",

I am creating this pull request in hopes of merging this feature before the 2.5.x release window, as many would benefit from being able to use ```scrcpy``` with root access, without being able to run ```adb root``` since Android's new restrictions on the ```adbd``` daemon now being an APEX module. The initial idea and most of the groundwork was done by @RiggiG and I mainly just fixed up a few things that would have prevented it from merging with the current state of the ```dev``` branch, as well as a few things that caused other problems.\r\n\r\nDuring testing, I have found that on an Android 14 AVD rooted with Magisk (instead of ```adb root```), I was able to see bidirectional clipboard access working, along with display, audio, and even settings changes working without problems. The only thing that is somewhat janky about the settings changes is that since ```AID_SYSTEM``` does NOT have write access to the settings database, actual root access is required by ```AID_SYSTEM``` so the server-side executable can handle cleanup on exit properly. This was just rebased using ```git cherry-pick``` to be able to get the necessary changes pulled in, without having to see nearly 100 commits that duplicated the progress on the origin ```dev``` branch in the meantime.",
