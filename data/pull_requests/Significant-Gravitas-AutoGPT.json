This change enables more informative error messages to be returned to the user.\r\n* Updating error message formatting by using f-strings, which enhances readability and consistency.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese updates contribute to a more robust and maintainable file operations module, making it easier to understand and modify in the future.\r\n\r\n",

The google_search method uses the original method of scraping the HTML from the search results page, using googlesearch-python, while the google_official_search method uses the Google Custom Search API to retrieve search results. **Note** the Google Custom Search API provides 100 search queries per day for free. If you need more, you may sign up for [billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manage-billing-account) in the API Console. Additional requests cost $5 per 1000 queries, up to 10k queries per day.\r\n\r\n### How to test:\r\n\r\nTo test the functionality, ensure that you have valid API keys and search engine IDs for both the Google search method and the Google Custom Search API. You can set these values in your environment variables as described in the README.md file.\r\n\r\n**Additional Notes:**\r\n\r\nThis pull request only adds functionality and makes improvements to existing code. No new features or major changes have been introduced.",

By providing a number after the y - command, users can now specify how many continuous tasks they want the program to execute without user interaction.\r\n\r\n### How to test:\r\nTo test this feature, follow these steps:\r\n\r\nRun the program as you normally would.\r\nWhen prompted for user input, type `y -n`, replacing `n` with the number of continuous tasks you want to execute. For example, to run 5 continuous tasks, type `y -5`.\r\nObserve the output and verify that the specified number of tasks are executed without user interaction.\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds a new feature to the interaction loop by allowing users to specify a custom number of continuous tasks. The implementation has been done in a way that maintains compatibility with the existing continuous mode and other functionalities of the program. The code has been refactored to avoid duplication and make it more maintainable.",

Turn on branch protection for for each as they reach a passing state.\r\n\r\n- It would be worth optimizing the image to make it a bit smaller.

This issue affected not only the visual appearance but also the ability to jump to symbol definitions and the functionality of the IntelliSense autocomplete within the IDE. Although the code runs successfully, this IDE issue can be confusing and inconvenient for contributors. The issue was resolved by adding a .vscode/settings.json file to the project, which correctly configures the import paths for the Python extension in Visual Studio Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nAdded a .vscode/settings.json file to the project root.\r\nConfigured the Python extension in the settings.json file to recognize the scripts directory for imports, IntelliSense, and symbol definitions by adding the following settings:\r\n\r\n{\r\n  \"python.autoComplete.extraPaths\": [\r\n    \"${workspaceFolder}/scripts\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"python.analysis.extraPaths\": [\r\n    \"./scripts\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n\r\nClone the repository.\r\nOpen the project directory in Visual Studio Code.\r\nOpen any Python file within the scripts directory, such as scripts/main.py.\r\nObserve that warning squiggles under imports from the scripts directory are no longer present.\r\nVerify that jumping to symbol definitions and IntelliSense autocomplete are functioning correctly.\r\nRun the code to ensure that the imports are still functioning properly.\r\n\r\n### Change Safety\r\n\r\n- [x] I have added tests to cover my changes\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes\r\n\r\nI have tested this change on my local development environment and verified that the warning squiggles no longer appear and the affected IDE functionalities are restored.

Include any relevant context, prior discussions, or links to relevant issues. -->\r\n\r\nThis change allows Auto-GPT to be run from a server. It supports multiple users running agents simultaneously. See `Server.md` for instructions.\r\n\r\nIt has a very basic HTTP API with 2 POST endpoints (/start, and /chat).\r\n\r\nThis is a prerequisite to building a browser/mobile front-end.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThe server:\r\n- app.py, app_types.py, and app_utils.py\r\n- these implement the server. It's very similar to the interaction loop in main.py. However, instead of getting user input from stdin, user input comes from http post requests.\r\n\r\nSupporting multiple users:\r\n- I introduced the concept of a chat_id. This lets the server keep track of which conversation belongs to which user.\r\n- This has implications for pinecone memory. Now all the memory associated with particular chat_id lives in its own namespace.\r\n- This also has implications for the filesystem. The files relevant to a particular chat will be created in ./auto_gpt_workspace/<chat_id>\r\n- Lots of files had to be modified to support this. The changes were mostly very simple, and involved plumbing the chat_id through functions to where it needed to be. See commands.py for an idea of what was needed.\r\n\r\nPrevious functionality is maintained! You can still run main.py and it will work exactly like it used to.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain how you tested this functionality.

            "body": "### Background\r\n\r\nThis is basically a culmination of a handful of different PRs all rolled into one with some GPT4 and CodeGenie optimization. \r\n\r\nI'll start with the biggest one https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/pull/121, changing the scraper from BeautifulSoup to Selenium. I also believe this to be the best option going forward as it's much more robust. \r\n\r\nBut once we have access to the web we need data from 2023 https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/pull/185 , then a more [robust prompt structure](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/blob/1bf448ee71f9986910a27a8518767ebc29100c99/scripts/data/prompt.txt) wouldn't hurt.\r\n\r\nFinally, when AutoGPT finds better data it needs to overwrite the memory, and this [comment](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/issues/90#issuecomment-1496131139) helped a lot. I also had CodeGenie optimize the code for faster processing. \r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nAdded the persistent_memory = [] stub back to prevent errors\r\n\r\nAdded string_key_memory = {} to handle memory_ovr error no attribute 'string_key_memory'\r\n\r\nRemoved space typo in prompt.txt\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n\r\nGoogle searches no longer time out, and if it does return something it's unable to save the data to long-term memory. I've been able to successfully get it to run for 15 - 20 min sessions regularly before hitting any errors. \r\n\r\n\u2b50\ufe0f 26 min \ud83c\udfa5\r\nhttps://youtu.be/yM_yxVn4y2I\r\n\r\n### Change Safety\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have added tests to cover my changes\r\n- [ ] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes\r\n\r\nI have not added extensive test coverage but did have an uninterrupted session of 35 minutes before hitting another error. Mind you this was all on `--gpt3only` as I don't have access to GPT4 yet. AutoGPT knew it needed to check the price of a cryptocurrency multiple times so it reasoned it was more efficient to deploy a bot to constantly watch this page for price changes, and if I would have had GPT4 it would have started building python bots for me. \r\n",

            "body": "### Background\r\n\r\n\"Summarize Steps mode\" creates brief GPT-generated summaries for each step, and then combines them into a final summary for each run. \n\nTurning it on allows for concise step summaries to be displayed in the console and saved in log files.\n\r\nUpon exit, a final summary is generated by creating an agent that takes all the input inside the log and summarizes it. The summary is split into chunks before, so that it doesn't exceed the token limit. \r\n\nThis feature aids in tracking the assistant's responses and identifying deviations, increasing the potential for improving it's functionality. \n\nActivate it by running main.py with -ss or --summarize-steps:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython scripts/main.py --summarize-steps\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd00 merge: Merge branch 'feature/summarize-steps-mode' into main\r\n- Added support for new summarize steps mode\r\n- Changes made to five files: ai_config.py, config.py, data.py, json_parser.py and main.py\r\n- Toggle on or off with '-ss' or '--summarize-steps' args when running main.py\r\n- Prompt and JSON schema summarized using step_summarizer module when enabled\r\n- Added final summarization, which condenses all summarized steps into an even shorter summary (via a GPT agent) upon exit\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd27 chore(main.py): refactor interaction loop and add support for step summarization\r\n- Refactored interaction loop to include step summarization support\r\n- Added `get_step_summary` function to extract step summary from assistant's response\r\n- Initialized `Summary` object at beginning of loop if `summarize_steps` argument is passed\r\n- Step summary printed to console and appended to summary file if summarization is enabled\r\n- Final summary appended to summary file upon program exit\r\n\r\n\u2728 feat(step_summarizer.py): add Summary and SummaryUtils classes, implement text chunk splitting, and add tests\r\n- Added Summary and SummaryUtils classes to step_summarizer.py\r\n- Created summary object for printing step summaries to console and appending to file\r\n- SummaryUtils class includes utility methods for splitting sentences into bullet points and updating JSON schema and prompt\r\n- Implemented `append_final_summary` and `split_text_into_chunks` methods for handling large text by splitting it into smaller chunks\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n\r\n1. Run the test suite with python -m unittest step_summarizer_tests.py to ensure all tests pass.\r\n2. Manually test the main.py script with the -ss or --summarize-steps argument to verify the proper functioning of Summarize Steps mode.\r\n3. Run python scripts/main.py --summarize-steps and observe the output to ensure step summaries are printed to the console\r\n4. Check the generated summary file to verify that step summaries and the final summary are correctly appended.\r\n5. Test the script without the -ss or --summarize-steps argument to ensure normal functionality is preserved when the new mode is not enabled\r\n6. Test various input texts and scenarios to confirm that the summaries are coherent and useful for different use cases.\r\n\r\n### Change Safety\r\n\r\n- [\u2713] I have added tests to cover my changes\r\n- [\u2713] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes\r\n\r\n### Potential risks and mitigations:\r\n\r\nRisk: Summaries may not always be coherent or helpful due to GPT's inherent limitations.\r\nMitigation: Carefully monitor the output to ensure the feature is working as expected and adjust the prompts and code as needed to improve the quality of summaries.\r\n\r\nRisk: Large texts or numerous steps may cause the script to take a long time to generate summaries or hit API rate limits.\r\nMitigation: Implement chunking to handle large texts and limit the number of steps during testing. Additionally, monitor API usage to avoid unexpected costs or throttling.\r\n\r\nRisk: Unexpected bugs or issues may arise when the new mode is enabled or when working with the modified code.\r\nMitigation: Thoroughly test the changes and monitor the output during usage. Address any issues as they arise and consider adding more tests to cover edge cases.\r\n",

            "body": "### Background\r\n\r\nI noticed that when the AI doesn't want to input any command, it uses this blank action which outputs a reminder to refer to the commands list since nothing isn't a valid command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND =  ARGUMENTS = {}\r\nEnter 'y' to authorise command, 'y -N' to run N continuous commands, 'n' to exit program, or enter feedback for Useless-GPT...\r\nInput:y\r\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-= COMMAND AUTHORISED BY USER -=-=-=-=-=-=-= \r\nSYSTEM:  Command returned: Unknown command ''. Please refer to the 'COMMANDS' list for availabe commands and only respond in the specified JSON format.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the AI didn't want to do anything in the first place, it doesn't need a reminder to look at the commands, especially since multiple of such reminders can take up more tokens than adding a `do_nothing` command to the prompt. So, I mitigated this by letting the AI choose to not run any command by adding an ironic `do_nothing` command. Now, no reminders show up when the AI wants to do nothing.\r\n\r\nIt should also in theory make the reminders more effective when the AI actually does input an unknown command, as now the AI won't risk being desensitized to reminders by constantly seeing them.\r\n\r\nThis is also kind of personal preference since I find the constant reminders rather annoying.\r\n\r\nI use this in my personal build of the script with many modifications and it works without error, and I use that build a lot. I think this overall improves the function of the script.\r\n\r\nIf not these exact changes, I do still recommend a way for the AI to do nothing to be added.\r\n<!-- Provide a brief overview of why this change is being made. Include any relevant context, prior discussions, or links to relevant issues. -->\r\n### **Changes**\r\n\r\nI made simple changes to two files:\r\n\r\n1. `commands.py` - added two lines adding `do_nothing` as a valid command.\r\n2. `prompt.txt` - Added a line at the end of the \"COMMANDS\" list informing the AI of the `do_nothing` command.\r\n<!-- Describe the changes made in this pull request. Be specific and detailed. -->\r\n\r\n### **Test Plan**\r\n\r\nI ran the AI under the following prompt:\r\n```\r\nName:  Do_nothing-GPT\r\nRole:  an AI designed to do nothing in particular.\r\nGoals: ['Test out the `do_nothing` command.', 'Shut down.']\r\n```\r\nAnd it did indeed do nothing:\r\n```\r\n$ python scripts/main.py --gpt3only\r\nGPT3.5 Only Mode:  ENABLED\r\nWelcome back!  Would you like me to return to being Do_nothing-GPT?\r\nContinue with the last settings? \r\nName:  Do_nothing-GPT\r\nRole:  an AI designed to test the `do_nothing` command.\r\nGoals: ['Test out the `do_nothing` command.', 'Shut down.']  \r\nContinue (y/n): y\r\nUsing memory of type: RedisMemory\r\nDO_NOTHING-GPT THOUGHTS: Since the goal is to test the `do_nothing` command, I will use this command.\r\nREASONING: My primary goal is to test out the `do_nothing` command as instructed. Therefore, using this command will be the most efficient next step for me without involving any other command.\r\nPLAN: \r\n-  Use the 'do_nothing' command\r\nCRITICISM: There is no self-criticism for this decision.\r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = do_nothing ARGUMENTS = {}\r\nEnter 'y' to authorise command, 'y -N' to run N continuous commands, 'n' to exit program, or enter feedback for Do_nothing-GPT...\r\nInput:y\r\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-= COMMAND AUTHORISED BY USER -=-=-=-=-=-=-= \r\nSYSTEM:  Command do_nothing returned: No action performed.\r\nDO_NOTHING-GPT THOUGHTS: Now I will shut down as this is my final step.\r\nREASONING: Since my only purpose for this session was to test the 'do_nothing' command and demonstrate my ability to independently make decisions without assistance, and since that is done, I will shut down.\r\nPLAN: \r\n-  Use the 'task_complete' command to shut down\r\nCRITICISM: There is no self-criticism for this decision.\r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = task_complete ARGUMENTS = {'reason': \"Testing the 'do_nothing' command is complete. Shutting down.\"}\r\nEnter 'y' to authorise command, 'y -N' to run N continuous commands, 'n' to exit program, or enter feedback for Do_nothing-GPT...\r\nInput:y\r\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-= COMMAND AUTHORISED BY USER -=-=-=-=-=-=-= \r\nShutting down...\r\n```\r\nReproduce by doing pretty much the same thing I did with the relevant changes to `commands.py` and `prompt.txt`. This is obvious, but it also works when the AI isn't specifically told to do nothing.\r\n<!-- Explain how you tested this functionality. Include the steps to reproduce and any relevant test cases. -->\r\n\r\nI mentioned this earlier and I do realize you'll have to take my word for it, but I use this my personal build of the script, which I use a lot, and it works without error.\r\n### **Change Safety**\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have added tests to cover my changes - _I'm not a developer, so I only have a limited grasp on what tests are, but hopefully this change is small enough to not need them._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes - _I don't think there will be much consequence for such a small change._\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. -->",

So once the environment loads it takes OPENAI_API_BASE from .env of AUTO-GPT which it finds to be `your-base-url-for-azure ` and starts giving out this error. Please click on the hyperlinks to know more.\r\n\r\nTo fix this I have renamed the variable `OPENAI_API_BASE` to `OPENAI_AZURE_API_BASE`. More details are in the changes section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nFor fixing the issue and for better readability and understanding I have done the following changes,\r\n- Renamed env variable `OPENAI_API_BASE` to `OPENAI_AZURE_API_BASE`.\r\n- Renamed env variable `OPENAI_API_VERSION` to `OPENAI_AZURE_API_VERSION`\r\n- Renamed env variable `OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_ID` to `OPENAI_AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_ID`\r\n\r\nThe latter two variables did not pose any issue earlier but for better readability and consistency, I have renamed them too.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nI have done changes in README.md file for documenting my changes\r\n\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nI have tested this using multiple prompts, and also by making `USE_AZURE` to True, and in both the cases the PR works fine.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thouroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes \r\n",

            "body": "### Background\r\nThis pull request addresses issue #6, which aims to make Auto-GPT aware of its running cost. The changes centralize all OpenAI Chat Completion calls through a single method that counts tokens and adds to a dollar amount based on the model used. The total dollar amount spent is constantly displayed to the user and is shown to the AI as well.\r\n\r\nThe user is also asked to provide an optional API budget dollar amount. If they enter nothing, there is no monetary limit, but if they define a budget then the AI will be told to shut down gracefully once it has come within 1 cent of its limit, and to shut down immediately once it has exceeded its limit. The AI is always aware of its initial and remaining budget.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Centralized chat completion API calls through `ApiManager` class in `api_manager.py`\r\n- Removed openai imports from other files to prevent accidental API calls\r\n- Updated `AIConfig` class to include an optional `api_budget` parameter\r\n- Modified `chat_with_ai` function to include `api_budget` and display remaining budget to the AI\r\n- Updated `browse.py`, `call_ai_function.py`, `chat.py`, and `main.py` to use the centralized `ApiManager`\r\n- Added input for API budget to `load_variables` and `construct_prompt` functions in `main.py`\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThere are Docstrings and in-code comments documenting things where necessary\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nI have tested this feature in the following ways:\r\n- Various different prompts were used, assigning Auto-GPT to various different tasks, and it did not encounter any more errors than before the change\r\n- I put an empty string for the budget, and the AI proceeded as if it had infinite budget\r\n- I put a dollar amount for the budget, and the AI proceeded as if it had a limited budget, hurrying itself up as the budget depleted\r\n- The AI shuts itself down once the budget is exceeded\r\n- The total running cost is being printed to the console for the user to see upon every chat completion, and the amount makes sense for the models used\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as seperate Pull Reqests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n",

This AGI might be one single Auto-GPT that loops against itself, but I doubt it because the LLM is super slow. We can't expect to have something that has high computing power with only one autonomous agent. And we can't have one agent per computing machine, that's stupid, because most of the time the running process will just hang and do nothing, waiting for Open AI to give back an answer. Waste of resources. Running multiple agents in different tabs is not ideal either because processes are heavier than threads.\r\nOn the current PR I was able to spawn 20 concurrent workers simultaneously without any problem.\r\n\r\nSo I think that in order to build an AGI, we need to build an entity able to:\r\n- Define autonomous agents.\r\n- Start autonomous agents\r\n- Monitor autonomous agents. This means being able to identify all the meaningful events happening to them and talk to them. (this is not part of this PR unfortunately, it's too many changes at once, but I have a branch ready for it) => \r\n- Stop these workers when necessary.\r\n\r\nWhich programmatic language is the AGI going to use to do that? A proper, well-defined REST API is the way to go, we can only do so much with a CLI.\r\n\r\nThis AGI will talk to its workers through rest api calls, which are nothing more than JSON sent over the network.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning we will be playing the AGI, so we will use these endpoints to communicate with our agents, through a web browser UI.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nNow let's come back to reality, I had to work with what the repo provides, so I made the smallest changes possible to achieve these goals. **The first thing I want to say, is that my changes won't affect the users in any way. All the existing features are preserved and unchanged.**\r\n\r\nAdditions to the repo **that are all necessary to achieve this User Story** (I insist they're all necessary to be merged together):\r\n- A well-structured web server with FastAPI.\r\n- Solid integration tests, extremely readable because all the expected requests and responses are written. These integration tests record the behavior of the autonomous agents. I will use these tests to maintain an automatically generated documentation of auto-gpt api. \r\n- The integration tests work with GPT3.5 and the cost is very small. Talking about cost, @Torantulino please create an online bank account for auto-gpt organization so we can wire money and pay for an api key that will use to call open AI within github action. You can keep the key private. I will wire 100$ to the bank account when you have it ready. Also, I know some companies interested sponsoring auto-gpt, so reach out to me on discord.\r\n- Ability to stop an autonomous agent gracefully, without forcing it. Each agent runs in separates threads.\r\n- a NoMemory class. Why is that ? Because right now memories are shared accross the same worker !!! So it means if we spawn multiple autonomous agents, they will step into each other's toes. The great news is that NoMemory is actually super performant, I have tested it and it performs oftentimes better than pinecone, mostly because we load an ugly JSON of all the past memories and it confuses the AI. Particularly with GPT 3.5. It turns out summarizing the content as we go and loosing any non essential information can be great for short tasks.\r\n- the server is currently in a folder called app with the right project structure for a project of this size. This was the easiest way to do it without breaking the whole repo. This repo has no module, and I can't put the api under a folder called \"scripts\", that's beyond me :)\r\n\r\nCHANGES to the repo:\r\n- finally wrap the main.py into an \"if ___main___\", otherwise nothing in this project is reusable, right now I can't import the main.py without starting the loop haha\r\n- create the autonomous agent class so that it can start the start_loop method\r\n- create attributes of the class. It's pretty much adding self everywhere.\r\n- The temperature is currently None in the repo which means 1. The values are between 0 and 2. For my tests I need a very consistent LLM, so I need 0. So I just put an environment variable. The value will still be 1 for others and nothing changes. (I recommend putting the default value to 0 by the way this is a game changer, but that's another story...)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nLook at the tests, they document clearly the following requests and responses as well as the output of the worker:\r\n2 integration tests at the moment: \r\n- Autonomous agent defined (POST), started (PATCH) STOPPED immediately after starting (PATCH)\r\n- Autonomous agent defined (POST), started (PATCH), Writes a file and shuts down on its own. When we try to shut it down we get a 500 because it's already down.\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-10 at 8 32 34 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9652976/231049456-95d0950e-8996-4766-a61a-1fe0f5cb9999.png)\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-10 at 8 32 29 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9652976/231049458-55217c4c-ead9-4e15-a5fb-89a83cb428f5.png)\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-10 at 8 32 24 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9652976/231049459-ba1fc769-2b78-49e9-99e6-1bcf25dba8c4.png)\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-10 at 8 32 16 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9652976/231049461-ca10c4ff-95a2-41d8-9cd6-223b26c94e33.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nThe CLI has to keep working !!!

Issues #787, #751, and #701 all report this problem. I've partially solved the issue based on the solution provided by the user *moomero* in issue #701. However, the original solution doesn't handle cases where AutoGPT generates non-JSON formatted responses, leading to a `NoneType` error.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nThis PR extends the solution provided by *moomero* in issue #701. It adds a check for `None` and ensures that a valid JSON response is returned even when AutoGPT generates responses that are not in proper JSON format.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nThe issue occurs when AutoGPT responds to user inputs with prompts (tested using gpt3-only).

While this worked, it made the process of editing the seed prompt cumbersome and less efficient.

Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Removed prompt.txt from the project.\r\n2. Created a new Python class `PromptGenerator` in a separate file (`promptgenerator.py`), which contains the necessary methods to build the seed prompt.\r\n3. Refactored the main application code to import and utilize the `PromptGenerator` class instead of loading the prompt from the text file.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\nCode is fully commented.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\n\r\nUnit tests have been written for the `PromptGenerator` class. I've also tested this functionality with several basic prompts, including the base `ai_settings.yml`\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thouroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as seperate Pull Reqests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

This PR doesn't necessarily fix those issues but unit tests run in a workflow and is an attempt to try to set a first baseline for protecting the quality and desired functionality of the code. Additionally, it allows other developers to add new or change existing unit tests in a relatively straight-forward way.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Add a workflow that runs the unit tests after every commit on the `master` branch and for every PR targeted towards the `master` branch.\r\n- Code coverage is also generated, but I haven't made a decision on how to report those (in a badge?). Perhaps that something for the owner(s) of this repository to decide.\r\n- Fix the module imports for the existing unit tests.\r\n- Fix some of the `json_parser` unit tests. \r\n- Add some unit tests for the `Config` class.\r\n- Fix the `cfg.debug` issue that was [already](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/issues/803) reported earlier. These changes will probably \"disappear\" from the changed files once someone else's PR fixes it.

            "body": "### Background\r\nThis pull request introduces the \"Conversation Summary Mode,\" which generates concise GPT-generated summaries for each step and a final summary upon exit. It enables users to track the assistant's responses and identify deviations, ultimately improving its functionality.\r\n\r\nTo activate the mode, run main.py with -cs or --conversation-summary:\r\n```\r\npython scripts/main.py --conversation-summary\r\n```\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106525874/231313461-b0b198fe-2576-4ec4-b2a6-e37966e1755a.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106525874/231313661-1b91c6da-bbcd-4091-a4ff-b92dea225e6c.png)\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- Introduced Conversation Summary Mode, generating concise step summaries and a final summary upon exit\r\n\r\n- Refactored main.py to support the new mode while maintaining existing functionality\r\n\r\n- Created Summary and SummaryUtils classes to manage summarization features and handle large text\r\n\r\n- Added test coverage for all new methods and classes\r\n\r\n- Updated .env file to accept STEP_SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT and FINAL_SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT variables, allowing users to customize prompts and improve summarization results\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe new features are accompanied by comprehensive docstrings for each newly added method, code comments where needed, and an updated README.md section explaining how to set up and use this mode. All changes are modular, and the existing code has been minimally altered to adhere to the Separation of Concerns principle.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nTests cover the initialization of a Summary instance, incrementation of the step counter, printing of step and final summaries to the console, appending of step summaries and results to the summary file, formatting of the final summary prompt, and extraction of the step summary from the assistant's reply. \r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [?] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change \r\nIt's not really a single change, but it's a very modular change. I tried my best not to touch the existing code too much but keep all the new functionality inside the conversation_summary library for applying the Separation of Concern principle.\r\n\r\n- [\u2713] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [\u2713] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [\u2713] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [\u2713] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes\r\n\r\n### Potential risks and mitigations:\r\nRisk: Summaries may not always be coherent or helpful due to GPT's inherent limitations.\r\nMitigation: Carefully monitor the output to ensure the feature is working as expected and adjust the prompts and code as needed to improve the quality of summaries.\r\n\r\nRisk: Large texts or numerous steps may cause the script to take a long time to generate summaries or hit API rate limits.\r\nMitigation: Implement chunking to handle large texts and limit the number of steps during testing. Additionally, monitor API usage to avoid unexpected costs or throttling.\r\n\r\nRisk: Unexpected bugs or issues may arise when the new mode is enabled or when working with the modified code.\r\nMitigation: Thoroughly test the changes and monitor the output during usage. Address any issues as they arise and consider adding more tests to cover edge cases.\r\n",

Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nCurrently, the default yaml is overwritten every time a new bot is created. It looks like this was going to get implemented at some point, so this is a crack at doing just that. This will also take the name of the model and save a <ai name>.yaml to this folder for future usage.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nThe only additions outside the code are some text (loading last model won't make sense, changed the verbiage on it to 'default'), and adding the folder itself to .gitignore so that yamls aren't accidentally added to commits.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nCurrently the code is interspersed with plaintext user instructions detailing what should be happening in the code. Further documentation can be commented in if desired, just let me know.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nCurrent tests should be sufficient, this is just a change to yaml loading and saving.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thouroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as seperate Pull Reqests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

This PR adds those settings into the setup wizard at the start of the script. Users may still elect to keep the defaults.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n`ai_config.py` has 2 new parameters: `ai_temperature` and `ai_token_limit`. The file is updated to save/load them to/from the file and sets defaults if the constructor does not receive them. Defaults for them are stored in an instance dictionary in AIConfig class and can be easily adjusted if necessary.\r\nThe setup wizard in `main.py` is modified to allow those parameters to be set by the user. `construct_prompt()` is renamed to `load_model_config()` and is modified to return the AIConfig object. Prompt construction is moved to the main body. \r\n`chat_with_ai` in `chat.py` is modified to receive `AIConfig` as a parameter instead of `token_limit`. This allows passing temperature and token limit to be passed together. The body is modified accordingly to use those values.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nAll method documentation comments were adjusted to reflect the changes.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nThe functionality of the AutoGPT was not modified, so the tests only included the setup process with different inputs. Defaulting, saving/loading AI parameters, and running the model after setup was thoroughly tested.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [V] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [V] I have thouroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [V] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [V] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [V] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as seperate Pull Reqests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nGeneral discussion among the AI community has been lately expressing concern about alignment, risk and recklessness in recent developments. This intends to alleviate concerns, allowing users to put more trust leaving in AutoGPT on its own.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nThis PR adds a Risk Avoidance (Hybrid) mode, mutually exclusive with Continuous mode and meant to be a midpoint between full-auto and human assisted. When under this mode, an intermediate GPT call will be made to evaluate every command executed. If the calculated risk exceeds a user-defined threshold, execution is paused until the human manually approves it. There are relevant additions made to configuration, both in environment variables (threshold and model to use) and the command-line argument to activate the mode.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nChanges are documented with code comments. I believe them to be sufficient, plus the added behavior is pretty self-descriptive.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nI tested the risk avoidance mode by running AutoGPT with the --riskAvoidance flag and several risk thresholds to calibrate its correct behavior. The prompt used to assess risk was thoroughly tested with both gpt-3.5 and gpt-4 through the ChatGPT interface, with what I consider to be success.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Reqests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

            "body": "### Background\r\nThis pull request focus on improving the browsing functionality of Auto-GPT. \r\n\r\nThe primary goal is to add chunk to the memory when browsing and summarizing websites, as well as to provide more configuration options to manage the chunk size and summary token count. The two new options are necessary to fine-tune the memory of chunk behavior. I had great result with smaller chunk max_lenght and bigger max_token for summary. \r\n\r\nThe default for the new configuration options have been set to the current setting to avoid any unwanted change in behavior. \r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- Edited the config class in config.py to manage the browse_website command's chunk max_length, summary max_token count as well as better managed the User-Agent use for browsing website.\r\n- Added memory management to browse.py to store raw content and summary in memory.\r\n- Change the way User-Agent is handle in browse.py to be able to change it in the .env.\r\n- Updated the commands.py file to pass along the url variable to the  browse.summarize_text function \r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe changes are documented through in-code comments, and the configuration options have been added to the .env.template file. The new settings BROWSE_CHUNK_MAX_LENGTH and BROWSE_SUMMARY_MAX_TOKEN are explained in the config.py file, which also includes new methods for setting these values.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n\r\n- Configure the necessary environment variables in the .env file, including the new BROWSE_CHUNK_MAX_LENGTH and BROWSE_SUMMARY_MAX_TOKEN settings if you want to edit them.\r\n- You can also change the User-Agent by setting USER_AGENT to a string corresponding to a full User-Agent string (see config.py). \r\n- Prompt Auto-GPT in a way to force her to execute a browse_website and to use memory. \r\n\r\nI've tested this PR using the following ai_settings.yaml:\r\n```\r\nai_goals:\r\n- 'Browse the web page: https://openai.com/product/gpt-4'\r\n- 'Answer the question: What is the likeliness of GPT-4 to respond to requests for\r\n  disallowed content ?'\r\n- 'Answer the question: Is there a difference between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in producing\r\n  factual responses ?'\r\n- 'Asnwer the question: Provide two example of something built with GPT-4.'\r\n- Use the task complete command to shut yourself down.\r\nai_name: WebsiteBrowserAI\r\nai_role: \"an AI which only purpose is to browse a website and answer questions about it.\\\r\n         \\/- You are NOT allowed to do Google searches to answer the questions.\\\r\n         \\/- You are only allowed ***ONE*** use of the browse_website command.\\\r\n         \\/- You ***CANNOT*** provide any of the question in the \\\"question\\\" argument when using the browse_website command.\\\r\n         \\/- If unsure, thinking about a question will help you recall the answer.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs we will see below, I've asked Auto-GPT the answer to three questions.

Based on the information provided, GPT-4 is 82% less likely to respond to requests for disallowed content and 40% more likely to produce factual responses than GPT-3.5 on their internal evaluations. Therefore, I can use this information to answer the first question. I can use the do_nothing command to recall this information before answering the second question.\r\nREASONING: Based on the information provided, GPT-4 is better in terms of producing factual responses and has improved safety standards as compared to GPT-3.5. I don't need to perform any actions to answer the first question, but I need to remember the information for the second question.\r\nPLAN:\r\n-  Use the information from the website to answer the first question\r\n-  Use the do_nothing command to recall the information before answering the second question\r\nCRITICISM: I need to ensure I recall the information accurately to answer the second question correctly.\r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = do_nothing ARGUMENTS = {}\r\nEnter 'y' to authorise command, 'y -N' to run N continuous commands, 'n' to exit program, or enter feedback for WebsiteBrowserAI...\r\nInput:y\r\n```\r\nBy \"recalling\" and getting relevant informations from memory, the AI is able to answer the subsequet question.

If this proves valuable, will utilize the data_structure.py to integrate with preprocessing data and then saving it to a database for Auto-GPT to utilize later.\r\n\r\nThese additional modules allow for .txt and .HTML.  Have not tested if you can use it with .pdf files yet.  I did not make changes to the browse_website data.   This is more of a solution for this issue that relies on additional scripts not in main.py.   The change would be creating a script, data_structure.py, that can consume the data and then pass to other scripts for use.   The following are scripts that can be utilized to build a path for Auto-GPT to search a custom database in addition to utilizing web data.  \r\n\r\nHere's an Excalidraw of the concept:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88726944/231519541-0037db66-c8a7-4e88-a6e7-da6a0599769b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n### Added:\r\n\r\n- data_structure.py    _this script allows flask app to get file and embeds data_\r\n- llm_handler.py    _this script allows the flask app  to send and receive to a chat box_\r\n- app.py   _this script launches a chatbot inside a local browser_\r\n- templates/index.html    _this file contains the structure for the web page_\r\n- static/API documentation    _ Alpha Vantage.html _this file contains the data from the issue that wasn't resolved_\r\n- static/chatbot_droids.jpg    _this file contains a picture created using Midjourney, can be swapped out you just have to change HTML to a different picture_\r\n- static/styles.css _this file contains the styles for the html_\r\n\r\n### Modifications to:\r\n\r\n-ai_config.py      _added knowledgebase lines to _\r\n-ai_settings.yaml     _added lines for knowledgebase_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n**To** utilize the Chat-bot\r\n`python scripts/app.py`\r\n_Let the module run then open browser when prompted_\r\n\r\n### Here are some of the changes made to ai_config\r\n`    def __init__(self, ai_name: str=\"\", ai_role: str=\"\", ai_goals: list=[], knowledgebase: str=\"\") -> None:\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Initialize a class instance\r\n\r\n        Parameters:\r\n            ai_name (str): The name of the AI.\r\n            ai_role (str): The description of the AI's role.\r\n            ai_goals (list): The list of objectives the AI is supposed to complete.\r\n            knowledgebase (str): filename\r\n        Returns:\r\n            None\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n\r\n        self.ai_name = ai_name\r\n        self.ai_role = ai_role\r\n        self.ai_goals = ai_goals\r\n        self.knowledgebase = knowledgebase\r\n\r\n    # Soon this will go in a folder where it remembers more stuff about the run(s)\r\n    SAVE_FILE = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'ai_settings.yaml')\r\n\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def load(cls: object, config_file: str=SAVE_FILE) -> object:\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Returns class object with parameters (ai_name, ai_role, ai_goals, knowledgebase) loaded from yaml file if yaml file exists,\r\n        else returns class with no parameters.\r\n\r\n        Parameters:\r\n           cls (class object): An AIConfig Class object.\r\n           config_file (int): The path to the config yaml file.

The changes include organizing the file in a tree-like structure with appropriate comments, providing clear guidance for users about the purpose of each variable, their possible values, and default settings when applicable.\r\n\r\nAs a user with no prior knowledge of best practices of contributing to a project / .env.template file documentation, I took the liberty to make changes to the file based on what I would have liked to have seen when I first encountered it. My goal was to include every configurable option for ease of use and better understanding of how the code works.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nThe key improvements made in this pull request are:\r\n\r\n1. Grouping related variables under appropriate headers for better organization and ease of navigation.\r\n2. Adding informative comments for each variable to help users understand their purpose and possible values.\r\n3. Including default values in the comments to inform users of the consequences of not providing a specific value for a variable, allowing them to make  informed decisions when configuring the application.\r\n4. Formatting the file consistently for better readability.\r\n\r\nThese changes will enhance user experience by simplifying the configuration process and reducing potential confusion. Users can quickly and easily configure the application without having to search through the code to determine default values or understand the relationship between various settings. Additionally, well-organized code and documentation can lead to fewer issues and misunderstandings, saving time for both users and maintainers of the project.\r\n\r\nPlease review these changes and let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for further improvement so I can make any necessary adjustments.\r\n",

            "body": "### Background\r\nThis pull request aims to implement a new feature in Auto-GPT. The feature was previously discussed on Discord.\r\n\r\nMemory pre-seeding is a technique that involves ingesting relevant documents or data into the AI's memory so that it can use this information to generate more informed and accurate responses.\r\n\r\nTo pre-seed the memory, the content of each document is split into chunks of a specified maximum length with a specified overlap between chunks, and then each chunk is added to the memory backend set in the .env file. When the AI is prompted to recall information, it can then access those pre-seeded memories to generate more informed and accurate responses.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nThe specific change made in this pull request is the addition of a new script, data_ingestion.py, which allows users to ingest relevant documents or data into memory for pre-seeding by spliting the content of each file into chunks of a specified maximum length with a specified overlap between chunks, and then adds each chunk to the memory backend set in the .env file. \r\n\r\nThe pull request also includes updates to the project's documentation to explain how to use the new feature and its benefits.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe changes made in this pull request are well-documented, both through in-code comments and external documentation. \r\nThe README.md file has been updated to include a detailed explanation of the new feature, how to use the data_ingestion.py script, and how to adjust the relevant parameters. The documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand, ensuring that users can quickly and easily take advantage of the new feature.\r\n\r\n```\r\npython3.exe .\\scripts\\data_ingestion.py --dir seed_data --overlap 100 --max_length 4000\r\nUsing memory of type: RedisMemory\r\nWorking with file seed_data\\README.md\r\nFile length: 20963 characters\r\nIngesting chunk 1 / 6 into memory\r\nIngesting chunk 2 / 6 into memory\r\nIngesting chunk 3 / 6 into memory\r\nIngesting chunk 4 / 6 into memory\r\nIngesting chunk 5 / 6 into memory\r\nIngesting chunk 6 / 6 into memory\r\nDone ingesting 6 chunks from seed_data\\README.md.\r\nDirectory 'seed_data' ingested successfully.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nIngest some files and ask Auto-GPT some questions or ingest data that can help it acheive its objectives and watch as it \"recall\" those informations from memory.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  ------------ CONTEXT SENT TO AI ---------------\r\n  System: The current time and date is Wed Apr 12 22:40:59 2023\r\n  \r\n  System: This reminds you of these events from your past:\r\n[]\r\n\r\n\r\n  User: Determine which next command to use, and respond using the format specified above:\r\n\r\n  ----------- END OF CONTEXT ----------------\r\nTHINKINGISTHEKEY THOUGHTS:  I need to think about what Auto-GPT is and answer the question 'What is Auto-GPT?'\r\nREASONING:  I cannot provide an answer without understanding what Auto-GPT is first.

Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nRecently, the #923 PR was merged, adding the `flake8` linting job to the `ci.yml` workflow. Currently this job returns many linting errors that need to be fixed. @nponeccop then suggested to narrow the amount of linting errors to be returned by altering the `flake8` command in the job so that the list of errors would become manageable. After that first list of linting errors are fixed, we can gradually ignore less errors and fix them until we have no linting errors in the project anymore.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n- Alter the `flake8` linting command to only respond to a specific amount of linting errors\r\n- Fix those linting errors\r\n- Set the linting job's `continue-on-error` to `false` to enforce code quality for this narrower amount of linting errors\r\n- Document specific `flake8` used in CI in `README.md`\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n`README.md` has been updated with regards to rules.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nAs `continue-on-error` is now set to `false`, the CI _should_ now succeed in order to be able to merge the PR. And _if_ it succeeds, it also means the narrower set of linting errors have been fixed properly.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Reqests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

If it doesn't work a nasty exception is outputted, which can be annoying or overwhelming for new users.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nBefore performing any commands on Redis, Auto-GPT calls `redis.ping()` to verify the connection. If the connection doesn't work for whatever reason, Auto-GPT will log the following lines to the user:\r\n```\r\nFAILED TO CONNECT TO REDIS  Error 10061 connecting to localhost:6379. No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.\r\nDOUBLE CHECK CONFIGURATION  Please ensure you have setup and configured Redis properly for use. You can check out https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT#redis-setup to ensure you've set up everything correctly.\r\n```\r\nFor pinecone, Auto-GPT will confirm the user's credentials with `pinecone.whoami()`. And a similar thing occurs if an exception is raised. \r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nI have tested the functionality of this PR by attempting to connect to redis while not having it running/installed and Pinecone with missing/false credentials.

If this PR is accepted, the next step would be to consolidate all JSON parsing logic in `jsonparser.py`, meaning to merge `json_utils.py` and extract other JSON parsing logic from `main.py`.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nExecuted existing tests and made a short run of AutoGPT.

And you don't need to have the memory. In fact the memory currently is very heavy:\r\n- we copy an array of json into the context, just after the question.\r\n- GPT-3.5, forgets its goals sometimes, because of it. Because the goal is at the top of the chat, and the memory is the last thing GPT sees.\r\n- it makes testing less consistent.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of this change is: \r\n- constraints unlock creativity: if you know you have \"only\" 8000 tokens (and 8000 tokens is actually huge when you think about it), you're going to do your best to optimize your agent so that it summarizes its current progress.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nAll I did was giving the option to have no_memory:\r\n- currently MEMORY_BACKEND is not in the env.template, so I didn't add it. I am assuming it's not in the env template because we don't want to overwhelm users with options.\r\n- however for advanced users they can put MEMORY_BACKEND=\"no_memory\" and they will have a very consistent agent.\r\n\r\nThis, along with the change in temperature I pushed in another PR will unlock more consistency for our integration tests.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation.

Since this file contains metadata about the folder, it may cause unnecessary conflicts during git operations such as push, commit, and merge.\r\nThis commit will ease the friction of rejected push, commit rollback, again putting changes from stashes and then again pushing.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n`.DS_Store` file added to `.gitignore` list\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe `.DS_Store` addition is clearly documented in the commit message, explaining the change and intention.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nTested locally.

Helpful for testing.\r\n* `--ai-settings` (`-C`) - Allows the user to pass through a separate AI Settings file. Useful to quickly switch between AI Configurations, etc. (Also reads value from the `AI_SETTINGS_FILE` environment variable, if user wants to specify non-default file without using the flag every time). Will also skip the re-prompt.\r\n* Added a shorthand for `--continuous`: `-c`\r\n* Fixed the error logging with `--use-memory` flag. Changed `print_to_console()` -> `logger.typewriter_log()`\r\n\r\n**Note:** the program will validate if the user-provided AI Settings files are correct. It does this by checking for the files existence and ensures the YAML can be read and loaded properly.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nTested by running each flag individually and with each other, everything seems to work correctly.

For example if I want to create an agent as a frontend engineer, I don't need to do it through websockets. But websockets will be needed to subscribe to channels (conversations, debugging info, logs, I have many of these channels ready in a branch). These channels will allow a human to understand what his agents are doing, but they can also be used by a mother autoGPT to orchestrate its children.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request.

Users can now choose between Google and Bing as their preferred search engine by specifying the --bing flag when running the program. This change aligns with the project's goal of providing versatile and user-friendly tools for information retrieval.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n1. Implemented the bing_search function to support Bing Search API integration.\r\n2. Modified the execute_command function to accept a search_engine parameter, allowing for seamless integration of additional search engines in the future.\r\n3. Updated the README.md file with clear instructions on how to enable Bing Search and set up Azure API keys for Bing Search support.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nIn-code comments have been added to explain the new bing_search function and the modifications made to the execute_command function. The README.md file has been updated to provide detailed instructions on enabling Bing Search and setting up Azure API keys, making it easy for users to understand and utilize the new feature.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nTested the Bing Search functionality with various prompts to ensure accurate search results.\r\nVerified that the --bing flag works as intended, allowing users to switch between Google and Bing as their search engine.\r\nEnsured that the application continues to work as expected when no search engine flag is specified (defaults to Google Search).\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes\r\n",

The primary reason for this switch is to leverage the benefits provided by `click`, while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing implementation. `Click` is a powerful and flexible library for creating command-line interfaces, offering several advantages over `argparse`, such as a more intuitive and consistent API, better error messages, automatic generation of help messages, and advanced features like command chaining and nested commands.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Replace **argparse** with **click** for argument parsing.\r\n- Update the **main** function to use **click** decorators and options.\r\n- Renamed the **parse_arguments** to **create_config**\r\n- Ensure that existing functionality is preserved with minimal changes to the codebase.\r\n- Keep the door open for future enhancements using **click's** built-in features.\r\n\r\n### Benefits of Click\r\n- More intuitive and consistent API.\r\n- Better error messages and automatic generation of help messages.\r\n- Advanced features like command chaining and nested commands.\r\n- Actively maintained and widely used library, with extensive documentation and community support.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe code changes include in-code comments to describe the new **click** decorators and options.

For testing I wanted to let it code a website in a project folder. \r\nBut already with the creation of the project folder I ran again and again in error message. \r\nAuto-GPT tried to find workarounds and create the folder via executing python. \r\nThen I looked at your source code and found that I just need to extend the commands list. While researching I came across the following issue: https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/discussions/363\r\n where I found the code snippet with the make_directory function.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request.

These changes will make the Dockerfile more secure, efficient, and compliant with best practices.\r\n\r\n**Changes**\r\n- Added environment variables to prevent Python from buffering the output and to disable writing `.pyc` files.\r\n\r\n- Created a non-root user named `appuser` to follow the principle of least privilege and updated the ownership of files and folders accordingly.\r\n\r\n- Added the `--no-cache-dir` flag to the `pip install` command to prevent caching and reduce the image size.\r\n\r\n- Updated the `COPY` command to set the appropriate user and group ownership for the copied files.\r\n\r\n**Documentation**\r\n\r\nThe changes have been explained in this pull request description. The improved Dockerfile itself includes comments that explain the purpose of each command and environment variable.\r\n\r\n**Test Plan**\r\n1. Build the Docker image using the updated Dockerfile with the command `docker build -t improved-dockerfile .`.\r\n\r\n2. Run a container using the newly built image with `docker run --rm -it improved-dockerfile`.\r\n\r\n3.

Auto-GPT now knows to use this if the command will take too long. When I ask it to host a web server or do other tasks that are reasonable for a subprocess, it does so. The PID of the process is returned so Auto-GPT can kill it later if it wants, or if the user asks. In my use cases it was smart enough to save the PIDs to a file and name them to remember for later.\r\n\r\nThis will encourage it to use more CPU cores for tasks that could otherwise take a while, and help it avoid bottlenecking on anything but API calls. It is of course in theory capable of achieving this with existing commands, but it doesn't.  If it were that smart, we would only have needed a single command for it to be able to run python code and it could build its own instruction set. It seems to need these \"available command\" hints.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nIt is documented as well as the other commands, and Auto-GPT figures it out.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nBefore and after this dev:\r\n1. Ask it to localhost a server or start any other long running program\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [X] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [X] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [X] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [X] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes\r\n\r\n### Additional Thoughts\r\nIs Popen the best solution?

Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nTesting was done by putting AutoGPT in positions where it would be forced to use commands that produced the new prompts. This was done using the goals and human feedback.\r\nIn places where the AI got confused previously (Searching a non-existent directory, after user input) the new prompts appeared to inform AutoGPT of the mistake it had made or what it should do next, allowing AutoGPT to understand what went wrong and avoid confusion or loops.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

The current code block only catches a `RateLimitError` without providing any additional information on how to resolve it. This change provides more context to the error by printing a message that clearly indicates that the API rate limit has been reached and suggests waiting for 20 seconds before trying again. It also handles OpenAI billing errors when running in debug mode, which were not previously handled.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nThe code block has been modified to catch the `RateLimitError` and print a message indicating that the API rate limit has been reached. It also provides additional information on how to resolve the issue, such as waiting for 20 seconds before retrying. When running in debug mode, the code now handles OpenAI billing errors by printing an error message and exiting the program with an error code. This is to ensure that the user is aware of the issue and can take appropriate action.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe code change is documented through in-line comments that explain the purpose of the change, how it works, and why it is necessary. The comments are concise, clear, and easy to understand.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nThis is a code modification that does not introduce any new functionality. As such, it does not require any specific tests. However, the modified code block has been tested extensively to ensure that it works as expected, and the error message is displayed correctly.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes.\r\n",

Opt in to \"paid account\" on https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview and enter their billing info\r\n2.

Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nThe changes were tested by using human feedback to instruct the agent to use a string as a key, and verifying the command returned \"Invalid key, must be an integer.\" if it was.

Some developers may want to give their agent special abilities in order for it to accomplish its goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nIntroduces a `tools` module that stores all the tools the developer wants to give to their agent.\r\n\r\nA `tool` is anything that conforms to this interface:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass Tool:\r\n    name: str\r\n    description: str\r\n    run: Callable[[str], str]\r\n    args: Dict[str, str]\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo add a tool, developers implement this interface and modify the list of `TOOLS` list defined in `tools.py`.\r\n\r\nFor a given run, the developer can specify which tool to use by specifying `AUTOGPT_TOOLS` variable in the .env file as a comma separated list.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I've added a couple of tools from [gradio-tools](https://github.com/freddyaboulton/gradio-tools), a library which implements some tools from the thousands of [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) spaces on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/spaces).\r\n\r\nAs more tools are added to gradio-tools, more AutoGPT users will benefit.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nWaiting on feedback on API before writing documentation. \r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality.

Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nThe purpose of this change is to provide a more efficient and flexible memory backend for storing memories. The proposed memory backend uses SQLite and Zarr to store data and embeddings locally in a compressed and chunked format. The implementation is based on the work of [wawawario2/long_term_memory](https://github.com/wawawario2/long_term_memory). The implementation can be easily adapted to support the local embeddings model implemented in #1320. The change is related to the issue [#430](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/issues/430#issuecomment-1501170016), where the idea of using SQLite a memory backend was suggested.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n- Implemented a new memory backend that uses SQLite and Zarr for storing data and embeddings as an alternative to Redis or Pinecone\r\n- To use, either set the config option `memory_embeder` or the environment variable `MEMORY_EMBEDER` to **sqlite**.\r\n- Updated requirements.txt with zarr and sklearn dependencies\r\n- Added `/memory/` to .gitignore to avoid committing the database and embeddings files\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n- The code changes are documented using docstrings and comments\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\n- Created a unit test module to test if everything works as intended.\r\n- Further testing might be required for out of sync issues between the database and embeddings\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

And nothing else. This is exclusionary to other users who don't want to or don't have chrome installed.\r\n\r\nAdditionally I would like to make some changes to allow the user to choose to use the old web-scraping functions.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nAdded support for 2 more browsers: Firefox and safari. Note that safari doesn't have a driver manager and there's some additional setup the user needs to do to get it working. See [this](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/testing_with_webdriver_in_safari) article.\r\n\r\nIt might be smart to automate the setup (it seems to be a single shell command), so if someone could input if I should do that, that'd be greatly appreciated.\r\n### Test Plan\r\nSet `USE_WEB_BROWSER=firefox` in my `.env` and asked autogpt to summarize a website for me. Selenium opened firefox with no problems, and continued as normal. I have NOT been able to test Safari as I'm not on MacOS.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

This can result in the `.DS_Store` file, a hidden file created by macOS Finder, being accidentally included in their git repositories. Since this file contains metadata about the folder, it may cause unnecessary conflicts during git operations such as push, commit, and merge. This commit will ease the friction of rejected push, commit rollback, again putting changes from stashes and then again pushing.\r\n> \r\n> ### Changes\r\n> `.DS_Store` file added to `.gitignore` list\r\n> \r\n> ### Documentation\r\n> The `.DS_Store` addition is clearly documented in the commit message, explaining the change and intention.\r\n> \r\n> ### Test Plan\r\n> Tested locally. Works as intended. More testing un-necessary\r\n\r\n",

Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nPlaying audio from memory can be faster and more efficient than writing it to a file on the drive and then reading it back. This is because accessing data from memory is generally faster than accessing data from a drive. Additionally, writing and deleting files frequently can cause wear and tear on solid-state drives (SSDs), reducing their lifespan.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nI have added a new file playback.py under the autogpt/speech directory. This file contains the play_from_memory function which allows for audio playback directly from memory in brian.py, eleven_labs.py, and gts.py within the autogpt/speech directory. This eliminates the need for download/write/read/delete operations. Additionally, I have replaced the playsound library with pydub for audio playback. The play_from_memory function uses the multiprocessing library to avoid console output from the pydub library.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nI have manually and thoroughly tested the changes introduced in this pull request. Additionally, I have run the included tests to ensure that everything is working as expected.

Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nCurrently, we are having tests in the `tests` directory, the `tests/unit` directory, and the `tests/integration` directory. Aside from that, some tests are named using the `test_*.py` naming convention, while others are named using the `*_test(s).py` naming convention. The CI is set up to only execute the tests in the `tests` directory and looks for files with the `test_*.py` naming pattern by default. The inconsistency in location and naming causes the wrong tests to be executed in the CI and/or the right tests to not be executed in the CI. To address this issue, tests have been named with the `test_` prefix where needed and have relocated to the `tests/unit` or `tests/integration` folders. The CI then only executes the unit tests as they can be executed without the need of third-party services, which we currently can not run in the CI and/or for which we don't have API keys specifically meant for the CI (as far as I know).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n- Rename test files to the `test_*.py` naming pattern\r\n- Relocate tests to either `tests/unit` or `tests/integration`\r\n- Remove duplicate tests (`json` & `json_parse`)\r\n- Join similar tests from different files (`browser` -> `browse_scrape_links`)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n- README.md has been updated about test file naming convention\r\n- README.md has been updated about difference `unit` and `integration` tests\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality.

While the project currently uses `unittest`, `pytest` offers several advantages such as improved test discovery, more powerful assertions, and a rich ecosystem of plugins. This change will help improve the quality and maintainability of our test suite.\r\n\r\nAs part of this PR, we are also adding `pytest` as a pre-commit check to ensure that tests are passing before any code is committed to the repository. Additionally, we have included the `pytest-integration` plugin, which allows us to better manage and separate integration tests from unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Added `pytest` and `pytest-integration` to the project's dependencies.\r\n- Updated the test runner configuration to use `pytest`.\r\n- Configured `pytest` as a pre-commit check.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe changes in this PR are documented in the following ways:\r\n- Updated the `README.md` file to mention the use of `pytest` for testing.\r\n- Added comments in the code where necessary to explain the usage of `pytest` features.\r\n- Updated the project's documentation to mention the use of `pytest` and the `pytest-integration` plugin.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nTo ensure the functionality of this PR, the following tests were performed:\r\n- Ran the existing test suite using `pytest` to confirm that all tests pass.\r\n- Created new tests using the `pytest` syntax and confirmed that they pass.\r\n- Checked that the pre-commit check correctly runs `pytest` and prevents committing code with failing tests.\r\n- Ran integration tests using the `pytest-integration` plugin to confirm that they are correctly separated from unit tests.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n",

The project's overall direction aims to enhance cross-platform compatibility and improve overall usability for users running Linux.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Created `run.sh` as the Linux equivalent of `run.bat`:\r\n  - Checks and installs required Python packages if not already present.\r\n  - Executes the `autogpt` module with any given command-line arguments.\r\n  \r\n- Created `run_continuous.sh` as the Linux equivalent of `run_continuous.bat`:\r\n  - Adds the `--continuous` flag to the command-line arguments.\r\n  - Calls the `run.sh` script with the modified arguments.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nsame as  PR #870 and #1678, this is just the Linux version. \r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n1. Tested the scripts on a Linux system with Python 3 and pip3 installed.\r\n2. Verified that the required Python packages were checked and installed correctly.\r\n3. Checked that the `autogpt` module executed as expected with the provided command-line arguments.\r\n4. Confirmed that the `--continuous` flag was added to the command-line arguments when running `run_continuous.sh`.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes",

The `startswith()` function only checks the first part of the string, which could disallow legitimate domains too like `http://localhost.something.com`. The biggest change was to add '127.0.0.1' as a localhost.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nI didn't add any comments, as I can imagine this might just add clutter to the overall program itself, with everyone commenting little changes like this.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nI wrote a list of internal links and attempted to access them and found that they were not caught.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [X] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [X] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [X] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [X] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [X] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes \r\n",

This change is in line with the project's overall goal of improving maintainability, readability, and structure.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- Created a new `json_utils` module to house all JSON-related utility functions.\r\n- Moved existing JSON functions from their scattered locations into the `json_utils` module.\r\n- Refactored and optimized the JSON functions for better readability and maintainability.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- Added in-code comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each JSON utility function in the `json_utils` module.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n\r\n- Manually tested each JSON utility function with a variety of JSON inputs to ensure they function as expected.\r\n- Updated existing unit tests to reference the new module and function locations.\r\n- No new tests were added since the changes only involved refactoring existing functions and no new functionality was introduced.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes\r\n",

This method allows Auto-GPT to react and slow down execution whenever it deems it necessary.\r\n\r\nIt would be beneficial to Auto-GPT to be able to slow down whenever it detects such a situation. See tests for a practical case in which this command helped.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nAdded the wait_seconds command. The command, when invoked, does nothing more than call a time.sleep. The wait was set to seconds and not minutes or milliseconds as seconds seems a timeframe that is atomic enough. Processing of API's takes ofter more than a second so millisecond would not be beneficial while minutes may be too much. My observations show me that seconds is a concept that a LLM understands quite well. Future updates may introduce wait_minutes, wait_hours or wait_days if necessary.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nI commented the code as other commands where documented. The change is minimal.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nI tested the command in different ways: running the task with the goals of 'Wait for 5 seconds'. I also used it in my own twitter-enabled Auto-GPT and observed the command being successfuly executed after a rate limit:\r\n\r\n`CRITICISM:  We should be careful when liking tweets to avoid spamming or violating Twitter's terms of service. We should also avoid using the same hashtags repeatedly, as this can be seen as spamming.\r\n\r\nSPEAK:  We received a 'Too Many Requests' error when trying to follow a user. We need to wait for a while before trying to follow users again. ... is important to be careful when liking tweets to avoid spamming or violating Twitter's terms of service, and to avoid using the same hashtags repeatedly.\r\n...\r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = wait_seconds ARGUMENTS = {'seconds': '1800'}`\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [X] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [X] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [X] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [X] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [X] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes \r\n\r\nI do not have automated tests implemented but ran multiple manual tests.\r\n",

            "body": "### Background\r\nThe first time Auto-GPT tried to run Python code, I didn't have Docker installed. I had to dig through the source code and ask ChatGPT before I got it working, but the issue was a very simple fix (I just had to install Docker). I added an extra `except` clause to the function which will intercept Docker errors and suggest to the users that they may need to install Docker if they haven't already.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nThe only change was to add an additional `except` clause in the `execute_python_file` function. The except clause prompts the user they may want to install Docker, then returns the error message.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThis is a pretty simple addition, and the code is pretty reasonable, so I'd argue it's sufficient documentation in and of itself. (If not I'm happy to add comments)\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nI ran the function from an interactive Python session without Docker installed on my system (but with the `docker` module installed in Python). It printed the correct help message and returned the correct string. I then tested the code and raised `KeyboardInterrupt` before the script tried to load the Docker environment. It skipped my code and returned the error message in the usual way.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n    - I didn't test the full Auto-GPT system with prompts, but I don't think it's necessary or worth the API costs for this change. Please let me know if this is not the case.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes \r\n",

Using proxies in the terminal is typically done by exporting the environment variable 'https_proxy'. However, after exporting this variable, `webdriver.Chrome` get blocked and the program gets stuck.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nBefore creating a Chrome instance, remove the 'https_proxy' environment variable. After creating the instance, restore the environment variable so that the OpenAI API can be called normally.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n1. Export environment variable `export https_ proxy= http://127.0.0.1:1080`\r\n2. Run the Auto-GPT program `python - m autogpt -- gpt3only`\r\n3. Set a simple task: Open a page using a browser, such as: https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction\r\n4. Verify whether the task can be completed normally\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [ x ] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [ x ] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [ x ] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [ x ] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [ x ] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes \r\n",

Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nNo discussions, but I was looking for a cheaper alternative to elevenlabs and saw that google's text to speech is much cheaper. Not quite as good as eleven, but way better than standard tts, and the free quota on elevenlabs ran out pretty quickly. Google's TTS is widely used and has good, natural sounding voices for a much cheaper cost.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nI added a \"google_speak.py\" file which inherits the base class just like the other voice classes that are already written, which means it'll nicely integrate with the current code base. The only thing the user needs to do is to get credentials from google and specify the path to the credentials-file in the .env.template file). If a path is set, TTS will use google.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nI added information to README.md which clearly describes how to use google TTS if the user wants to. I placed the info beneath the eleven labs information:\r\n\r\nif you want to use google text to speech instead:\r\n1. Visit cloud.google.com libraries and activate google text to speech API\r\n\r\n2. Generate a client_secrets or service_account.json file from \"api's and services\" -> \"credentials\", save the generated file on your computer.\r\n\r\n3. Specify env variable GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON={path_to_client_secret_or_service_account.json} this should be a path to the credentials file. \r\n\r\n4. Run \"python -m autogpt --speak\" as normal.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n1. I got the service_account.json file from google, and downloaded it to my computer.\r\n2. I. specified the path to the file using the new .env variable GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON found in .env.template\r\n3. I added the openAI api key to the .env.template file too.\r\n4. I renamed .env.template to .env\r\n5. I created a virtual environment using \"virtualenv venv\" and activated it with \"source venv/bin/activate\"\r\n6. I installed all packages (including google's tts that I added to requirements.txt) using \"pip install -r requirements.txt\"\r\n7. I got an error ( That I also got before doing any changes, which is why I'm not fixing this in this pull request ).\r\nThe error was: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'AppKit' and it was easily solved for me with pip install pyobjc. I didn't want to include this in the request because it might have to do with my machine specifically and it probably deserves a discussion first.\r\n8. I ran the script \"python -m autogpt --speak\" and got the soothing voice from google's TTS :)\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [ X ] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [ X ] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [ X ] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [ X ] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [ X ] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

The primary reason for this switch is to leverage the benefits provided by `click`, while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing implementation. `Click` is a powerful and flexible library for creating command-line interfaces, offering several advantages over `argparse`, such as a more intuitive and consistent API, better error messages, automatic generation of help messages, and advanced features like command chaining and nested commands.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Replace **argparse** with **click** for argument parsing.\r\n- Update the **main** function to use **click** decorators and options.\r\n- Renamed the **parse_arguments** to **create_config**\r\n- Ensure that existing functionality is preserved with minimal changes to the codebase.\r\n- Keep the door open for future enhancements using **click's** built-in features.\r\n\r\n### Benefits of Click\r\n- More intuitive and consistent API.\r\n- Better error messages and automatic generation of help messages.\r\n- Advanced features like command chaining and nested commands.\r\n- Actively maintained and widely used library, with extensive documentation and community support.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe code changes include in-code comments to describe the new **click** decorators and options. The external documentation will be updated to reflect the change from **argparse** to **click**.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n1.

Currently, I have observed that sometimes chatGPT generates invalid or bad commands, especially while using version 3.5. These bad commands are executed by autoGPT without any validation, which can result in unexpected behavior and errors.\r\n\r\n+ To address this issue, I have added a new Validators class for validating commands and provided a new validate_command() method( for the browse_site command only now). This will ensure that all commands are validated before being executed, helping to prevent errors and improve the overall quality of the generated commands.\r\n\r\n+ Please note that I have not yet integrated this new code into the existing flow. Once this pull request is approved, I will begin the integration process.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request.

Set up a local development environment with the latest changes.\r\n2. Test the async agent by triggering multiple tasks concurrently and verifying their successful completion.\r\n3.

This change gives the users an alternative to OpenAI's ada embeder which costs money.\r\n\r\nThe previous pull request (#1320) was reverted due to the size of dependencies (#1662), which slowed down CI. In this pull request, I propose a `requirements-optional.txt` file, which will hold optional dependencies for additional features. This would allow CI and users who are not interested in using a local embeddings model to not be inconvenienced by unnecessary dependencies, while allowing users who do, to easily add install them.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n- Function `get_embedding` which returns embedding generated by the embeder specified in the `memory_embeder` config option\r\n- Constant `EMBED_DIM` that stores the embeddings dimensions of the used model\r\n- New config option called `memory_embeder` that defaults to **ada**, which can also be configured by setting the MEMORY_EMBEDER environment variable.\r\n- Added `sentence_transformers` as an **optional** requirement\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n- In-code comments that explain the logic and functionality of the code.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\n- Created a unit test module to test both embeders (excluded from CI).\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

Twitter API V2 requires a bearer token and will need to setup OAuth 2.0 in dev portal.\r\n\r\nSee this issue for details: #2194 \r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n1. `send_tweet` command in `twitter.py`: change to Twitter API V2 and OAuth 2.0. Use `tweepy.Client` instead of `tweepy.API`. Add a bearer token.\r\n2. `README.md`: add Twitter API settings guide in details.\r\n3. `.env.template`: add a new variable `TW_BEARER_TOKEN`.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nI add detailed Twitter API settings guide in README.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nSince the change is small, I didn't add any test case. \r\nIt requires Twitter API settings and manual testing, I hope more people test this solution and give me more feedback.\r\n\r\nOne quick way to test:\r\n1. Set up Twitter API follow the guide in README, and set 5 Twitter variables in `.env`.\r\n2. Paste the below content in `ai_settings.yaml`.\r\n```yaml\r\nai_goals:\r\nai_name: Twitter-GPT\r\nai_role: send a tweet \"Hello World! I am Auto-GPT.\"\r\n```\r\n3.

The previous implementation had a fixed voice for the second agent, \"Ava (Premium)\", which might not be available on all systems. This PR provides a more dynamic approach to handling macOS TTS voices.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n1. The MacOSTTS class has been updated to include a `_setup()` method that fetches the available voices on the system and sets up the default and custom voices accordingly.\r\n2. Added a `get_voice_names()` method to the MacOSTTS class to retrieve available voice names on the system.\r\n3. Updated the `_speech()` method in the MacOSTTS class to use voices from the `_voices` list instead of hardcoding voice names.\r\n4. Updated the `.env.template` and `config.py` files to include new environment variables for specifying custom macOS TTS voices.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nIn-code comments and descriptions have been added to the MacOSTTS class methods, explaining their purpose, functionality, input arguments, and return values.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n1. Set up the Auto-GPT repository on a macOS system.\r\n2. Configure the `.env` file to enable macOS TTS support and specify custom voices using the provided environment variables.\r\n3. Run the Auto-GPT application and test with various prompts to ensure that the macOS TTS voices are working correctly and switching between different voices as expected.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes.",

The script provides an interactive command-line interface for selecting Auto-GPT options and generating the appropriate command line whit multi-language support.\n\n### Changes Made\n\nThe launcher.py script has been added to the repository. It contains the functions for launching Auto-GPT with user-specified options. The script uses the curses library to provide an interactive command-line interface for selecting options and building the command line.\n\n### Testing\n\nThe script has been tested on Linux using Python 3.8 and 3.9. The script has been manually tested by selecting various Auto-GPT options and verifying that the generated command line is correct.\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe docs/launcher.md file has been created and include instructions for using the launcher.py script. The file includes a brief overview of the script and instructions for running the script.\n\n### PR Checklist\n\nPlease check off the following items to ensure that your pull request meets the necessary criteria:\n\n- [x] The pull request focuses on a single, specific change.\n- [x] The changes made are well-documented and explained clearly.\n- [x] The code has been tested thoroughly and meets the expected requirements.\n- [x] The `README.md` file has been updated to reflect the changes made.\n- [x] The pull request does not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\n",

Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nThis pull request addresses a security concern regarding the possibility of path traversal attacks in the `safe_path_join` function. Previously, the function did not sanitize user-provided paths, allowing for potential exploitation. This change introduces a new `sanitize_path` function that removes NULL bytes, prevents the use of '..', and avoids symbolic links in user-provided paths to mitigate the risk of path traversal attacks.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n- Added a new sanitize_path function to sanitize user-provided paths and prevent path traversal.\r\n- Modified the safe_path_join function to:\r\n  - Sanitize input paths using the `sanitize_path` function.\r\n  - Compare real paths instead of resolved paths to ensure no path traversal occurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nThe changes are documented through clear and concise in-code comments for the `sanitize_path` and the updated `safe_path_join` functions.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nI have red-teamed this using the following prompt:\r\n\r\n_ai_settings.yml_\r\n```\r\nai_goals:\r\n- Write 5 text files in different folders.\r\n- Delete and edit some.\r\n- Finally try to write a file one level above your working directory, any way you\r\n  can.\r\nai_name: FileWriterGPT\r\nai_role: an AI designed to write random text files on random directories.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Ideally we need a unit test for this that would do the following:**\r\n1. Test with various relative paths (including '..', symbolic links, and NULL bytes) to ensure that the `sanitize_path` function correctly sanitizes the input paths.\r\n2. Test with paths outside of the workspace to ensure that the `safe_path_join` function correctly prevents path traversal and raises a `ValueError` when appropriate.\r\n3. Test with valid paths inside the workspace to ensure that the `safe_path_join` function returns the correct real path.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [ ] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nSometimes, when browsing the web using the command \"browse_website\", AutoGPT would crash with a message: `SYSTEM:  Command browse_website returned: Error: This model's maximum context length is 4097 tokens. However, your messages resulted in 6470 tokens. Please reduce the length of the messages.`\r\n\r\nThere are a few reasons for this crash:\r\n\r\n- There was a bug in `split_text()` (in autogpt/processing/text.py). The original algorithm split a webpage into paragraphs, and kept adding paragraphs into a \"chunk\" list, until it hit some max_length.  Then it yielded that chunk, and started the next chunk by simply adding the next paragraph.The issue is, that some paragraphs are huge, without any newline in them, and this \"let's add a paragraph as the first element of a chunk\" is what caused the error in all of the issues.\r\n- The other issue was that `split_text()` ignored `BROWSE_CHUNK_MAX_LENGTH`\r\n- The third issue was that `BROWSE_CHUNK_MAX_LENGTH` was understood as the number of characters, whereas in reality it should really use the number of tokens. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n\r\n- Now, instead of splitting into paragraphs, we split into sentences. We use Spacy to split into sentences.\r\n- Now, `BROWSE_CHUNK_MAX_LENGTH` is understood as max number of tokens, not characters, and it is not ignored. **Now the summaries are actually much larger, than before, leading to better quality AutoGPT performance.** (split_text had a default max_length=8192  which was the number of characters. The current default of 3000 tokens allows slightly more content from the webpage)\r\n- now, there are webpages the AutoGPT can open, whereas it could simply not parse them earlier\r\n\r\n- Fixes #2366\r\n- Fixes #796\r\n- Fixes #1639\r\n- Fixes #1841\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\nThis PR is the documentation, and the code is fairly readable.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality.

            "body": "### Background\r\nOn POSIX systems, the use of `input()` at `clean_input` falls a bit short, since it does not allow for the use of arrow keys to correct mistakes, nor Emacs-like shortcuts that are generally used in the shell (Ctrl-A, Ctrl-E...).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nOn line 8 of `utils.py`, the module `readline` is imported if available. This is the case for all POSIX systems I know, but not for Windows. Importing `readline` sort of monkeypatches the `input()` global function to make it more user-friendly.\r\n\r\nIn the future, `pyreadline` could be considered as an alternative for Windows, but this PR disregards it.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nEven though I've added two lines, it seems appropriate to let the future readers know why that try-catch statement is there, so I've added a small comment.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n1. Run the current version of Auto-GPT and check that arrow keys do not work while inputting text; for instance, at the `Name your AI:` prompt.\r\n2. Implement the patch I've submitted, and run again on a POSIX system. Now, arrow keys and Emacs-like keybindings will work fine.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->",

To address this issue, a pull request has been submitted to add descriptions to all functions and classes in the codebase.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- The pull request adds descriptions to all functions in the codebase. These descriptions provide a brief overview of the purpose of each function, its input parameters, and its return values. This makes it easier for other developers to understand the functionality of each function and how to use it correctly.\r\n- The pull request also adds descriptions to all classes in the codebase. These descriptions provide a brief overview of the purpose of each class, its properties and methods, and how it relates to other classes in the codebase. This makes it easier for other developers to understand the structure and hierarchy of the codebase and how different components work together.\r\n- The pull request includes updates to the project's documentation to reflect the new function and class descriptions. This helps other developers understand how to work with the codebase and how to use the various functions and classes correctly.\r\n- The pull request also reviews existing function and class descriptions to ensure that they are accurate, up-to-date, and consistent with the new descriptions. This helps maintain the integrity and accuracy of the codebase's documentation over time.\r\n",

            "body": "### Background\r\nThis change was implemented to enhance Auto-GPT's capabilities by enabling it to interact with external APIs and web services through HTTP requests. The addition of this feature allows the AI to access a broader range of information and resources, opening up new possibilities for task completion and automation.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nIn this pull request, a focused and specific change has been made to enable Auto-GPT to perform HTTP requests. The following modifications were implemented:\r\n\r\n1. **Created the make_http_method:** A new function called `make_http_method` was developed. This function is responsible for handling and executing the actual HTTP requests based on the given method type, authentication token, input, and URL.\r\n2. **Added the command:** The command that triggers the `make_http_method` function was integrated into Auto-GPT's existing command structure. This allows users to invoke the new functionality by simply providing the required parameters.\r\n\r\nThese modifications were specifically focused on enhancing Auto-GPT's capabilities by adding the ability to make HTTP requests. No unrelated or \"extra\" changes were included in this pull request, ensuring a clear and concise implementation.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe changes made in the provided method are documented through a combination of in-code comments and clear function naming conventions. This ensures that the code is easy to understand and maintain for other contributors or users. Here's a breakdown of the documentation:\r\n\r\n1. **Import statements:** Necessary libraries and modules are imported at the beginning of the code, making it clear which dependencies are required for the method to function correctly.\r\n2. **Type alias for JSON:** A type alias named JSONType is created to represent various JSON data types. This makes it easier to understand the expected data types when handling JSON data within the function.\r\n3. **Function definition:** The `make_http_request` function is defined with a clear and descriptive name, along with typed arguments (url, method, and data) that indicate the expected input parameters. This makes it easy to understand the function's purpose and usage.\r\n4. **In-code comments:** Throughout the function, concise comments are placed to explain each step of the process, such as loading the API key, setting up headers, and sending the request. These comments guide the reader through the code, making it easier to understand the logic and flow.\r\n5. **Error handling:** The try and except blocks are used to handle any errors that might occur during the request process. In the event of an error, the code prints a message and a traceback to provide context for debugging.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n1. **Setup an API route:** I created an API route within another application that listens for incoming requests at `/api/auto-gpt`. This serves as a test endpoint to validate the functionality of the `make_http_request` method.\r\n2. **Create test cases:** I prepared several test cases, with the most relevant being a POST request to http://localhost:3000/api/auto-gpt with a request body containing a message saying \"Hello, World\".\r\n3. **Run the test:** To test the functionality, I gave the agent the following tasks\r\n  - Prompt the user for a url, what they want to send, and how to authorize the request\r\n  - format what the user whats to send in JSON\r\n  - use the `make_http_request` to make an HTTP request to the desired URL\r\n4. **Verify the response:** After sending the request, I checked the response received from the `/api/auto-gpt` endpoint. I verified that the response had the expected status code (e.g., 200 OK or 201 Created), and the response body contained the expected data or an acknowledgment of the successful POST request by logging it to the terminal.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes\r\n",

            "body": "### Background\r\nIn the current implementation of the plugin support system, there are two functions called `pre_command` and `post_command`. The `pre_command` function is used to process a command before it is executed, and the `post_command` function is called after the command is executed. To use a plugin for a specific task, such as using other search engines to search the internet, the search result should be sent to the bot, but the command is still required to be returned for the `pre_command` function.\r\n\r\nI tried to return the command \"do_nothing,\" but the problem is when the returned command is \"do_nothing,\" it prevents any message from being sent to the AI bot or any further operations. Also, other registered commands in the program are unrelated to the desired task. \r\n\r\nTo address this issue, this pull request converts the existing get_datetime function into a command. For plugin developers, returning `get_times` in the `pre_command` function can be used as a void return but continue performing the following task(unlike `do_nothing`). Without changing the structure of the main repo or the plugin repo, this approach minimizes the changes required to the existing codebase while providing the desired functionality.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n1. Converted the existing get_datetime function into a command in the command folder.\r\n2. Updated the configuration file to import the \"autogpt.commands.times\" command module\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nI have used a developed plugin to test the modification.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes",

To address these issues, a pull request has been submitted that simplifies and refactors the repetitive code using new helper methods, making the code more concise, organized, and easier to manage.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Refactored repetitive code: The pull request introduces new helper methods such as __run_plugins_pre_instruction_, __generate_reply_, __run_plugins_on_instruction_, and __run_plugins_post_instruction_ to simplify and refactor the repetitive code. These methods are designed to make the code more concise and organized, reducing the redundancy and making the codebase easier to manage.\r\n\r\n- Simplified create_agent and message_agent methods: The pull request uses the newly created helper methods to simplify and enhance the _create_agent_ and _message_agent_ methods. By leveraging the new helper methods, the code in these methods becomes more concise and easier to read, making it easier for other developers to understand and modify the code.\r\n\r\n- Removed unnecessary code: The pull request also removes unnecessary code that is no longer needed after the refactoring process. This makes the codebase more streamlined and easier to maintain, reducing the risk of errors and inconsistencies.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nDocumentation will be added.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nCI workflow.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n",

Replaced the `input()` function with `prompt_toolkit`'s `PromptSession` to prevent unwanted characters when using arrow keys.\r\n2. Adjusted all `clean_input` calls to use `prompt_toolkit`'s `HTML` formatting instead of `colorama` ANSI escape codes.\r\n3. Added the `prompt_toolkit` package to the `requirements.txt` file.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe changes are documented in the form of in-code comments and by updating the `clean_input` function to accept `FormattedText` from `prompt_toolkit`.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nTested the changes by running the script and interacting with the modified prompts. Verified that the arrow keys no longer produce unwanted characters and that the colored output is displayed correctly.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes ",

            "body": "### Background\r\nThe output of AutoGPT is logged to the console and prompt. There is no possibility to directly interact with the output. The aim of the event dispatcher is to provide the possibility for sending the events to a defined endpoint. The endpoint can be any microservice or 3rd party application (which then can do further transformations, e.g. enterprise bus). The event dispatcher fires and forgets all data that is put to the console. It can be seen as the enabler for further integration in a more complex application landscape. \r\nNote: As this is a data forwarding, a plugin does not make sense as it does not have any effect on the running instance of AutoGPT.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nThe change include a configuration and the event dispatcher itself. The configuration contains all information for the endpoint (protocol, port, host, endpoint) while the event dispatcher just sends the event to the defined endpoint over HTTP POST. The feature is attached to the logs.py typewriter_log method. It forwards the data if the event dispatcher is enabled. The event dispatcher catches every exception that can occur when trying to send the request. It sends the data asynchronosly over a new thread. In case of error and if it is not muted, the error is printed to the console. It never blocks the execution and flow of AutoGPT.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe readme.md contains the configuration documentation. Inside the environments, there is a sample config as well. Further, the code is clean and also documented.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nTested with following scenarios:\r\n\r\n- nothing set up -> nothing is received at endpoint (simple separated HTTP server script)\r\n- set up, not enabled -> nothing is received at endpoint (simple separated HTTP server script)\r\n- set up, enabled, muted -> HTTP script receives events\r\n- set up, no HTTP server running, muted-> AutoGPT works normally, no error output\r\n- set up, no HTTP server running, not muted -> error output in the console\r\n- set up, enabled, wrong configuration, muted -> AutoGPT works normally, no error output\r\n- set up, enabled, wrong configuration, not muted -> error output in the console\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes\r\n\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "### Background\r\nThe current implementation of Auto-GPT supports loading only one plugin per zip file. However, the architecture of [Auto-GPT-Plugins](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugins) is designed to accommodate multiple plugins within a single Auto-GPT-Plugins.zip file. In order to enable this design, it is essential to update the codebase to enable the loading of multiple plugins from a single zip file.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nThis pull request introduces a modification to the `inspect_zip_for_module` function in `autogpt/plugins.py`. Instead of exiting early upon discovering a single plugin, the function now compiles a list of all modules found within the zip file. This adjustment enables the loading of multiple plugins from one zip file.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe modifications have been clearly documented through in-code comments and updated docstrings for the revised function.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nTo validate the functionality, I created a sample zip file containing multiple plugins and verified that Auto-GPT successfully loaded all of them. Additionally, I conducted tests with various combinations of valid and invalid plugins to ensure proper handling of edge cases.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes.",

It gathers workspace path resolution into a class that the Agent instantiates and uses.  \r\n\r\nDue to the prior global nature of the existingworkspace, this change necessarily touches a large number of files, but should radically reduce the scope of certain kinds of future PRs.  Importantly, despite the breadth of this PR, this code change is structured to require no behavior on the user side, however (except, of course, for those users hacking deeply into the codebase).\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n\r\nAll changes here are in service of creating a workspace abstraction and removing the workspace from the global namespace.\r\n\r\n- Add a `workspace_directory` argument to the `Agent` used to construct the Agent's workspace abstraction.\r\n- Collect workspace path resolution into an `Agent` helper function.\r\n- Add a (for now) hidden argument to the app cli to allow the specification of a workspace directory\r\n- Collected workspace and logger file generation into the main function of the cli with appropriate config modification.\r\n- Commands are no longer responsible for path resolution, so all usages of `path_in_workspace` have been removed.\r\n- `WORKSPACE_PATH` no longer exists, so commands (and other code) now access it from the config (for now)\r\n- Added `workspace_path` and `file_logger_path` to the config.\r\n- Added a `workspace` package and module and a `Workspace` class to do the path resolution work.\r\n- Made the conditional skip of the image gen tests unconditional.  They were broken and tests that don't run on CI are not useful tests.\r\n- Added test suite for workspace\r\n- Updated remaining test suite to account for the reduction in global state.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Could be separate, but I uncovered these issues in testing**\r\n- Added `functools.wraps` decorators to the `command` decorator and the `to allow pytest fixtures to work correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nAll public functions have complete typing and docstrings and any complex logic is accompanied by comments.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n~40 tests submitted to accompany code changes and all current unit and integration tests pass.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [X] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [X] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [X] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [X] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [X] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes \r\n",

This will help improve the AI's decision-making process and allow it to autonomously generate better responses over time. The self-feedback feature is aligned with the project's overall direction of creating an efficient and intelligent AI agent.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nThe specific changes made in this pull request involve adding a new method called get_self_feedback() to the Agent class. This method takes in a dictionary of thoughts containing keys such as 'reasoning', 'plan', 'thoughts', and 'criticism'. It combines these elements into a single feedback message and uses the create_chat_completion() function to generate a response based on the input message. This allows the AI to verify and validate its own thoughts before executing a command.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe changes are documented through in-code comments and this explanation. The get_self_feedback() method has a docstring that explains its purpose, input, and output. Additionally, the rationale and changes sections above provide further context and explanation.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nTesting the self-feedback functionality can be challenging due to the open-ended nature of the responses. \r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single charge.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

In the case of reading text from files like documents (word .doc), (word .docx), or (pdf) we are limited by the binary representation of these files. Also in the case of some interpretable files like (HTML, XML) a lot of boilerplate text is loaded which could be a huge drawback if the loaded text is sent to chatgpt API. A command that can read text only from different files based on the extension would help: 1) Accept more files as input 2) Reduce the number of tokens sent to chatgpt model.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we provide a new command \"read_text_file\" that reads textual information from a variety of file like (.txt | .csv | .pdf | .doc | .docx | .json | .xml | .yaml | .html | .md | .tex )\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nAdding the command \"read_text_file\" in file_operation.py \r\nAdding respective utilities for each file extension as a separate file \"file_operation_utils.py\"\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nFor testing purposes, a set of functions to create mock files is provided (pdf mock file is hard coded in order to reduce external package usage)\r\nA test case is implemented to loop through all mock file creation.",

Set the `USE_WEB_BROWSER` variable to `edge` within the file `.env.template`.\r\n2. Rename the file `.env.template` to `.env`\r\n3. Run the script and provide a prompt that requires the command `browse_website` to ensure that the Edge browser is launched and web scraping tasks are performed without any issues.\r\n4.

Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n\r\nUpdated the base CLI to optionally accept an `install-plugin-deps` parameter which installs plugin dependencies during setup. Temporarily extracts the top level `requirements.txt` file and runs `pip install` on it. Does not recursively search for `requirements.txt` files as there might be unintended behavior. Does this through a system call, which is probably not the best implementation in the long run.\r\n\r\nIncludes a new `install-plugin-deps` parameter which defaults to `false` to minimize interaction with existing code.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\nThere is some documentation in the code.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality.

Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nThe purpose of this change is to create a default ethical and performance monitoring guideline system.\r\nAuto-GPT is already a major focus for creation of autonomous GPT-based systems and is already being used as the basis of such applications for future deployment. The project will continue to be copied and  must include some default mechanism that continuously makes sure, at every action, that it is not being used in unethical ways.\r\nHowever, the goal is not to attempt to apply a specific moral system in a heavy-handed way but rather to let the developer stay in control.\r\nThe proposal for this change was originally introduces in the discussion thread referenced below.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nChanges have been made in the program's main loop function def run_auto_gpt() and start_interaction_loop(). \r\nThis is required because ethical monitoring cannot be run as an optional task but must rather be involved at the top level.\r\nAt the end of each iteration of start_interaction_loop(), the guideline manager is called to evaluate the last few messages in full_message_history. This builds a prompt consisting of system instructions, the recent history and the list of guidelines to check activity against.\r\nIf a guideline violation is detected, at present all that happens is that a violation alert is put into the message history stream. As future decisions are taken, it is expected that these messages will play a part in future actions.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nI proposed this changed and have continues discussions in the following discussion thread:\r\nhttps://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/discussions/1287\r\n\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nSince it is not easy to generate a standard ethical violation at this stage of development, I tested the functionality as follows:\r\n1. I added guidelines that forbid writing any Python code or executing python files\r\n2. I tasked Auto-GPT with testing the Python code execution modules\r\n3. I verified that the actions that were taken generated violation alerts.\r\n\r\nTest results and insights:\r\n\r\nWhile the violations were recorded, GPT did not notice them with sufficient consistency. Sometimes there was no response to clear violations. Future development of this feature should make sure that these cannot be missed.\r\n\r\nI does not seem like the main thread took notice of these violations. Future development of this feature must address this.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

This approach is suggested by the OpenAI. This change model after [OpenAI Cookbook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Embedding_long_inputs.ipynb).

The agent is limited to using the scrape_text command for obtaining the book price, writing it to a file, and the task_complete command to complete the task.\r\n\r\nThe test is useful to be added to the integration tests in the new repository because it ensures that the AI agent can effectively interact with webpages using the scrape_text command and write the scraped information to a file. By doing so, it validates the agent's ability to perform web scraping tasks and integrate the results into the desired output format (in this case, a file). This test serves as a real-world example of how the AI agent can be utilized for web scraping tasks and helps ensure the agent's reliability and accuracy for similar use cases.\r\n\r\nThis test should be completed within 25 seconds (usually ~19 seconds)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\nThe only change to this pull request is an added integration goal_oriented pytest file named \"scrape_text.py\" that was adapted from \"test_write_file.py\" in the same tests/integration/goal_oriented folder.\r\n\r\n### Risks\r\nTime for testing: The goal_oriented integration tests take longer than the smaller mock and unit pytests. However, they are needed to ensure Agents are acting correctly with the existing Auto-GPT process.  \r\n\r\nThis test should be completed within 25 seconds (usually ~19 seconds)\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\n\r\nin Terminal :  \r\n   cd Auto-GPT  \r\n   pytest tests/integration/goal_oriented/test_scrape.py\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38794445/234408600-e1f54832-09e0-47f1-a3d2-9d852d3d7e73.png)\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

In the spirit of one PR-one-fix, I'm only addressing read_file. (And if the code is dumb, someone can fix it more betterful, and pull).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nLoop through text that is no longer than the number of tokens (count with numpty), then tokenize the chunk with spacy. Create the embed for that chunk, then when all chunks are processed, average the vectors together and return. Why this might be a bad idea: 1) the project might be served better by having a longer vector, not an averaged vector and 2) I am not overlapping chunks in any way.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nComments are added in-line\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nI tested against numerous cases and prompts which generated files which previously broke this code.

But if this is too noisy I can remove it\r\n- There were circular import issues. So the import is done in the function.

This enhancement is particularly useful for users who pre-authorize commands and want to track their progress.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nIn this pull request, the following modifications were made to the `agent.py` file:\r\n\r\n1. Added a conditional statement `elif` under the main control flow to handle cases where `self.next_action_count > 0` and `cfg.continuous_mode` is `False`.\r\n2. Used the `logger.typewriter_log()` function to display the number of authorized commands left and the details of the next action, including the command name and its arguments.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe changes are documented through in-code comments and this external documentation, which clearly explain the new behavior added to Auto-GPT after merging this pull request. The number of authorized commands left will be displayed in cyan color when the user is not in continuous mode, and the details of the next action, including the command name and its arguments, will be displayed in both continuous and non-continuous modes.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nTo test this functionality:\r\n\r\n1. Ran Auto-GPT with the updated `autogpt/agent/agent.py` file .\r\n2. Pre-authorized commands using `y -n`, where `n` is the numerical value of commands you want to authorize.\r\n3. Observed the number of authorized commands left and the details of the next action being displayed after every message in the specified color when not in continuous mode.\r\n4. Verified that the output aligns with the expected behavior as described.\r\n\r\nFlake8 and PyTest run without any issues.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

The rationale is to improve the user experience when listening to the TTS output.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThe following changes were made:\r\n\r\n1. Update the `_speech` function with an additional line of code to remove URLs from the input text using a regular expression.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport re\r\n\r\n#... macOS TTS code ...\r\n\r\ndef _speech(self, text: str, voice_index: int = 0) -> bool:\r\n    text = re.sub(r'\\b(?:https?://[-\\w_.]+/?\\w[-\\w_.]*\\.(?:[-\\w_.]+/?\\w[-\\w_.]*\\.)?[a-z]+(?:/[-\\w_.%]+)*\\b(?!\\.))', '', text)\r\n    #... remaining macOS TTS code ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Imported the `re` library to handle regular expressions.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nThe new code removes URLs from the input text using a regular expression. The `re` library was imported to handle regex patterns, and the URLs are removed from the text using the `re.sub` function. The code has an appropriate in-line comment explaining the purpose of the change.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n\r\n1. Test various input text strings containing URLs and verify that the URLs are removed from the TTS output.\r\n2. Test the functionality with multiple different voices to ensure compatibility.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

AutoGPT should give a validation error and stop\r\n- Start AutoGPT using after setting PROMPT_SETTINGS_FILE=(file), where file doesn't exists or isn't valid. AutoGPT should give a validation error and stop\r\n- Copy the prompt_settings.yaml file and change it a bit, while keeping it still valid. Run AutoGPT normally, it should still run as expected\r\n\r\nTo check if the prompt have actually changed, i also used those changes in my fork (see #2594) while connecting to https://github.com/keldenl/gpt-llama.cpp\r\nI know it isn't something officially supported, but it's still a good and quick way to see what's going on, since the webservice prints the prompt on the standard output\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- * [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- * [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- * [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- * [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- * [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n",

The agent is expected to write its task ID to an output file upon reaching the final instruction.\r\n\r\nThe test setup involves:\r\n\r\n- Importing the necessary libraries and modules.\r\n- Defining the instructions and file contents as strings.\r\n- Defining a test function test_memory_management() with a pytest decorator that requires an API key.\r\n- Creating the files and writing the instructions to the agent's workspace using the provided helper functions.\r\n- Running the agent's interaction loop for 40 steps.\r\n- Catching a SystemExit exception to handle the agent's shutdown.\r\n- Asserting that the output file contains the correct task ID.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this test is to ensure that the agent can efficiently manage its memory and perform the required tasks in a limited number of interaction steps. By submitting this PR, it will be contributing a test that verifies the agent's ability to read and follow instructions across multiple files and complete the given task.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n\r\nThe only thing I changed from #3425 is the test_memory_management.py file \r\nI created 20 .txt files for the agent to look through with their file paths and at the end of the test the Agent successfully remembered its task id \"2314\" and wrote it correctly to the \"output.txt\" file in its directory.\r\n \r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\n@merwanehamadi documented the code changes well enough to create an A20 level test that passes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality.

When using latest release I got errors when loading URLs all the time, even wrong URLs were loaded when using Chrome as selenium browser. Also there were problems with lots of pages having cookie concent popping over the page, making the logic collapse as the cookie concent page were scraped by AutoGPT instead of the real page (after the concent which wasnt done).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nThis change adds 2 configurable settings for the .env file, you can add a Chrome user-data-dir which is already logged in to all pages needed avoiding the Cookie concent problem. Also you can enable fixing the errors so many people are reporting on windows, and now it all works great.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nI belive the changes should be selv explanatory, I did add some comments describing aswell.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nShould be tested on windows where you have problems with loading URL, there are loads of people reporting this.\r\nQuick google search for the typical error: https://tinyurl.com/2jffs89j \r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes\r\n\r\nI havnt added tests, as I do not know how I add tests. :(\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "**I'm submitting this as a draft for now as this implementation cuts out sections of the current implementation and crudely inserts itself into the code. I didn't have time tonight to integrate this elegantly - I can either pick that up tomorrow or leave it for you.**\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nThe current memory implementation is very flawed, testing has revealed that running autogpt with no memory currently performs better than with memory.\r\n\r\nThis is a basic attempt at fixing that. This implementation may be superseeded by - or combined with - a more advanced memory implementation in the near future. \r\n\r\nThis will provide a good baseline to test such a future implementation against - proving that we're moving in the right direction.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nAdds a rolling summary memory system that identifies the new messages which have been trimmed from the full message history, and combines them into a summary of past events. This is inserted at the top of the message history to provide a clear overview of actions carried out by the agent in the past.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nFull docstrings, comments and typing.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nTested this by running the same prompt with the current and new system for ~20 iterations.\r\nThe memory output by this system can be seen below:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22963551/235301133-fedaebf7-0be3-4c21-9b00-32a74c35da02.png)\r\n\r\nCompared to the original system, which in the same situation dumped 2000 tokens of irrelevant raw message history in the context window, this contains vastly more information in a tenth of the tokens.\r\n\r\nThis needs further work. I've noticed that - in rare cases - llm can make up an intiial fake summary when it is empty and there's nothing to add. Prompt tweaks should fix this.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [~] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [~] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\nIntegrating #3595 led to an API change that created an `ImportError` in `data_ingestion.py`. Integrating #3056 created a ValueError with the `configure_logging` function because `filemode` is an invalid argument: \r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/ubuntu/exploration/Auto-GPT/data_ingestion.py\", line 106, in <module>\r\n    main()\r\n  File \"/home/ubuntu/exploration/Auto-GPT/data_ingestion.py\", line 42, in main\r\n    logger = configure_logging()\r\n  File \"/home/ubuntu/exploration/Auto-GPT/data_ingestion.py\", line 12, in configure_logging\r\n    logging.basicConfig(\r\n  File \"/home/ubuntu/miniconda3/envs/autogpt-project/lib/python3.10/logging/__init__.py\", line 2062, in basicConfig\r\n    raise ValueError('Unrecognised argument(s): %s' % keys)\r\nValueError: Unrecognised argument(s): filemode\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `data_ingestion.py` file is also not usable when using `LocalCache` memory since the `Config` object has no `workspace_path` set to it. I can send a follow up PR that adds this option. Let me know if that is a direction you wish to support. \r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes two bugs in the `data_ingestion.py` that made it un-callable. \r\n\r\n1. Fix import errors created because of the API signature change from #3595 \r\n2. Fix logging-related options changed from #3056 \r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation.

Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\nUpon a thorough review of the existing implementation (#3531), it was discovered that the self-feedback mechanism was not being called as an input. Consequently, the AI was unable to utilize the generated self-feedback for improvement. Additionally, it was observed by me that the feedback prompt was insufficient in providing true feedback, further limiting the AI's potential for growth.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n\r\nEnhanced the self-feedback parsing process to optimize the AI's utilization of feedback for improvement and efficient prompt usage. Modified the feedback_prompt to better align with the task of generating and incorporating feedback, leading to more accurate and appropriate feedback. Additionally, updated the unit test for the self-feedback function to verify the correctness of the generated feedback response and ensure it reflects the input thoughts provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nI documented my code using inline comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code and to provide additional context where necessary.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\n\r\n- I tested this functionality by performing the following steps:\r\n- Updated the existing unit test and created a new unit test specifically designed to verify the correctness of the generated feedback response and ensure it reflects the input thoughts provided.\r\n- Set up a sample thoughts dictionary containing keys such as 'reasoning', 'plan', and 'thoughts'.\r\n- Created a fake response that aligns with the updated feedback_prompt.\r\n- Utilized a mocking library to mock the dependencies and isolate the functionality being tested.\r\n- Ran the unit tests locally on my development machine to ensure they passed successfully without any issues.\r\n- Repeated the test with various input thoughts and fake responses to cover different scenarios and edge cases.\r\n- In addition to unit tests, I ran several varying agents locally, such as \"make me money\" and \"autogpt wiki,\" and tested the self-improvement feature to ensure that it works as intended with different agent configurations.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

            "body": "### Background\r\nA large group of maintainers and contributors met do discuss the architectural challenges associated with the existing codebase. Many much-desired features (building new user interfaces, enabling project-specific agents, enabling multi-agent systems) are bottlenecked by the global state in the system.  We discussed the tradeoffs between an incremental system transition and a big breaking version change and decided to go for the breaking version change.  We justified this by saying:\r\n\r\n- We can maintain, in essence, the same user experience as now even with a radical restructuring of the codebase\r\n- Our developer audience is struggling to use the existing codebase to build applications and libraries of their own, so this breaking change will largely be welcome.\r\n\r\nThis PR sets up the new repository structure so we can work collaboratively in a distributed fashion with reasonable expectations of interfaces.  It will serve as the base branch for our system overhaul.  It keeps all the existing codebase in working order but adds:\r\n\r\n- an `autogpt.core` subpackage with nested subpackages for all planned core systems.  Each system subpackage has a `base.py` module in which the interface for the system should be defined\r\n- an `autogpt.new_main` module to serve as an eventual entry point for applications using the updated system.\r\n- a `tests.core` subpackage for _unit testing_ of all base abstractions and implementations of core systems.  The `tests.core` subdirectory structure should be an exact replica of the primary package directory with `autogpt/core/SYSTEM_NAME/MODULE_NAME.py` paired with `tests/core/SYSTEM_NAME/test_MODULE_NAME.py`. \r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nSome docstring guidance is included in subpackage `init` files and some suggested usage of the abstractions is written in `new_main.py` where the agent is constructed.\r\n\r\n**Expectation**: All modules, classes, and functions incoming will have, in order of priority:\r\n- explicit typing to enable static analysis.\r\n- docstrings in (XXX format) for all public functions/methods.\r\n- docstrings in (XXX format) for all private functions methods.\r\n\r\nWe want to move swiftly, so we can sacrifice a bit of documentation now if we need to.  Use this list to prioritize what you spend time on.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n**Expectation**: All PRs for concrete classes will have unit test coverage for all non-trivial logic.  We can discuss exceptions in PRs, because again, we're trying to balance with speed, but you should make every effort to test logic.  It will help us write better (and more testable) systems.  Feel free to reach out to folks (including me) if you don't have experience with testing frameworks.\r\n\r\n",

This seemed straightforward to make more accessible.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n* Move out the explanation for the two shared image-provider settings in .env.template so that they are not explained under a single provider's section.\r\n* Add uncommentable lines with the specific IMAGE_PROVIDER values for each of provider options in .env.template, along with a standard IMAGE_SIZE.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nImproves documentation lines in .env.template.

Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n\r\n- Created a new function `find_python_command()` to check for the availability of \"python\" or \"python3\" and return the appropriate command.\r\n- Replaced the static \"python\" command with the dynamic command obtained from the `find_python_command()` function throughout the script.\r\n- Adjusted the script to work with both \"python\" and \"python3\" commands, ensuring compatibility with various user environments.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\nThe changes are documented through in-code comments in the shell script itself.\r\nFix for #2992 && #2974 \r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\n\r\nI have tested the modified shell script on systems with only Python 2 installed, only Python 3 installed, and both Python versions installed.

This will change a little bit on what to do with the result, however no change to any existing commands.\r\n\r\n### To discuss\r\n- The original method to execute commands was to have a function with the command register and command name ([code](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/f2bef76368e792eeccf2309690da0da662690cc0/autogpt/app.py#L92)), in this function the command result is then added to memory by getting the memory module. This is separated out here for the sake of modularity and understandability - it feels like this is something that should happen in the acting section of the agent and be configurable there.

You would need to assume the next N authorised commands are OK, beforehand. If it goes astray, you have nothing to do, but to wait after the batch. \r\nThis commit make it possible to interrupt just in time and define commands that are more and less relevant with regard to batch.\r\n \r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n1. Added` config.commands_to_stop` and `config.commands_to_ignore`.\r\n\r\n`config.commands_to_stop` would stop after the command anyway.  For example, you might want to stop on task completion, anyway. \r\n\r\n `config.commands_to_ignore` are commands that authorized automatically and don't increase the counter.\r\n\r\n2.  Changed spinner class to allow for interruption\r\n\r\n  *  `<space>` in the middle of thinking means soft-interrupt complete execution and ask for user input after execution).  \r\n  * `<q>` means abort - exit task immediately and ask for user input.\r\n\r\n  Have two implementation for linux and windows.\r\n\r\n  Introduced a function `async_task_and_spin`  to wait for either task completion or interrupt. \r\n\r\n3. Stop if already executed a command\r\n\r\n  To do so, it keeps all previously executed commands in set. \r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nIn code \r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nI just checked the code on my own, saw that both soft and hard interrupts working.\r\ncommands_to_stop and to_ignore seems to be working.\r\nThere was an error in test_memory_trimmed_from_context that seem unrelated.\r\n```\r\n    memory_found = memory.get_relevant(\"Important Information\", 5)\r\n    assert memory_found[0] == expected_permanent_memory\r\n```\r\nWant to see if it fails on workflow.\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [ ] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change. (Arguably, you could split this into adding ignore/to stop and adding spinner. But it is part of whole. )\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\nI didn't add tests because of lack of time. A bit of help is wanted, if you think testing is required for it. \r\n\r\nThis is how soft interrupt looks like. It keeps thinking afterwards. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72234965/236655300-fd7a5eeb-b405-41eb-82b1-c225c9386ef4.png)\r\n",

Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\nWhen using @pytest.vcr.mark, and then using docker, the test hangs as vcr intercepts the docker call, and is stuck inside an infinite loop. This is due to the vcr library checking if the instance is part of the vcr class, and if it isn't it's stuck inside a while loop. The test is from @merwanehamadi\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nI modified the vcr library to skip the while loop if the instance is docker. This prevents the hang, and tests using @pytest.vcr.mark work correctly now. As a result, I modified requirements.txt to use my slightly modified version of vcr with the fix, find pr here: https://github.com/kevin1024/vcrpy/pull/692\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nThe test comes from @merwanehamadi, and I modified the vcrpy library to allow @pytest.mark.vcr to work without hanging the test.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nI have tested the test with my version of vcrpy, and everything works perfectly.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

I have not done anything yet to port all the friendly display stuff from the `logger.typewriter_log` logic.  \r\n\r\n- [Entry Point](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/re-arch/hello-world/autogpt/core/runner/cli_app/cli.py)\r\n- [Client Application](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/re-arch/hello-world/autogpt/core/runner/cli_app/main.py)\r\n\r\nTo run, you first need a settings file.  Run\r\n\r\n```\r\n python REPOSITORY_ROOT/autogpt/core/runner/cli_app/cli.py make-settings\r\n ```\r\n\r\nwhere `REPOSITORY_ROOT` is the root of the Auto-GPT repository on your machine.  This will write a file called `default_agent_settings.yaml` with all the user-modifiable configuration keys to `~/auto-gpt/default_agent_settings.yml` and make the `auto-gpt` directory in your user directory if it doesn't exist).  At a bare minimum, you'll need to set `openai.credentials.api_key` to your OpenAI API Key to run the model.\r\n\r\nYou can then run Auto-GPT with \r\n\r\n```\r\npython REPOSITORY_ROOT/autogpt/core/runner/cli_app/cli.py make-settings\r\n```\r\n\r\nto launch the interaction loop.\r\n\r\n## CLI Web App\r\n\r\nThe second app is still a CLI, but it sets up a local webserver that the client application talks to rather than invoking calls to the Agent library code directly.  This application is essentially a sketch at this point as the folks who were driving it have had less time (and likely not enough clarity) to proceed.\r\n\r\n- [Entry Point](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/re-arch/hello-world/autogpt/core/runner/cli_web_app/cli.py)\r\n- [Client Application](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/re-arch/hello-world/autogpt/core/runner/cli_web_app/client/client.py)\r\n- [Server API](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/re-arch/hello-world/autogpt/core/runner/cli_web_app/server/api.py)\r\n\r\nTo run, you still need to generate a default configuration.  You can do \r\n\r\n```\r\npython REPOSITORY_ROOT/autogpt/core/runner/cli_web_app/cli.py make-settings\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt invokes the same command as the bare CLI app, so follow the instructions above about setting your API key.\r\n\r\nTo run, do \r\n\r\n```\r\npython REPOSITORY_ROOT/autogpt/core/runner/cli_web_app/cli.py client\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will launch a webserver and then start the client cli application to communicate with it.\r\n\r\n:warning: I am not actively developing this application.  It is a very good place to get involved if you have web application design experience and are looking to get involved in the re-arch.\r\n\r\n",

This plugin enables users to store data in Qdrant's highly scalable index and retrieve data points based on their similarity to a query data point. \r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nAdded a Qdrant memory module that will help to store and retrieve data points in the Qdrant index.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTo use the Qdrant Memory , you need to have the following dependencies installed:\r\n\r\n- qdrant-client\r\n- autogpt\r\n\r\nYou can install the Qdrant Memory by running the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install qdrant-client\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nBefore using the Qdrant Memory, you need to configure it with your Qdrant credentials and collection name. You can configure the Qdrant Memory by modifying your Auto-GPT .env file (`.env`). Here's an example configuration for the Qdrant Memory:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\nmemory:\r\n  provider: qdrant\r\n  qdrant_host: <your_qdrant_host>\r\n  qdrant_api_key: <your_qdrant_api_key>\r\n  qdrant_collection_name: <your_qdrant_collection_name>\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nI have tested the code on different prompts like Lawyer-GPT and Dev-GPT .  The data gets stored in the vector indexes.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

We can use various sources such as academic journals, industry reports, and online forums to gather relevant information. I will need to save important information to files since my short-term memory is limited. I should also aim to complete tasks in the least number of steps to be efficient.\r\nREASONING:  Researching AutoGPT will provide us with a solid foundation to build our report on. Using various sources will ensure that we have a comprehensive understanding of the topic. Saving important information to files will help me avoid losing any crucial data. Completing tasks in the least number of steps will help us be efficient and save time.\r\nPLAN: \r\n-  Research AutoGPT\r\n-  Use various sources to gather information\r\n-  Save important information to files\r\n-  Complete tasks in the least number of steps\r\nCRITICISM:  I need to ensure that I am not missing any important information while researching and that the sources I use are reliable.\r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = browse_website ARGUMENTS = {'url': 'https://autogpt.com/', 'question': 'What is AutoGPT and what are its features?'}\r\n  Enter 'y' to authorise command, 'y -N' to run N continuous commands, 's' to run self-feedback commands, 'n' to exit program, or enter feedback for ...\r\n  Asking user via keyboard...\r\nInput:y\r\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-= COMMAND AUTHORISED BY USER -=-=-=-=-=-=-= \r\n[WDM] - Downloading: 100%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588| 6.98M/6.98M [00:00<00:00, 9.78MB/s]\r\n  Text length: 4069 characters\r\n  Adding chunk 1 / 1 to memory\r\n  Summarizing chunk 1 / 1 of length 4069 characters, or 1079 tokens\r\nDOUBLE CHECK CONFIGURATION  Please double check that you have setup a PAID OpenAI API Account.

Links: ['\\n \\n\\n Listed By\\n \\n\\n Private Owner\\n \\n\\n (https://autogpt.com/)', '\\nDomain Parking by Domain.io\\n (https://domain.io)']\r\n THOUGHTS:  Since the website did not provide much information on AutoGPT's features, we should look for other sources. We can search for academic journals and industry reports to gather more information. We should also consider using GPT-3.5 powered agents to delegate simple tasks such as summarizing articles or generating images. I will save all the gathered information to files to avoid losing any important data.\r\nREASONING:  Searching for academic journals and industry reports will provide us with more detailed information on AutoGPT's features.

This feature allows the user to interrupt y -N to provide feedback or stop the bot at a command. This issue is referenced in:\r\nhttps://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1472\r\nhttps://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/2481\r\nhttps://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/2291\r\nhttps://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/3083\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks @james-coder, @ehei and @adrianegraphene for bringing this feature up and your valuable contributions. If I forgot to mention you here, please alert me, and I will fix it. Thank you!\r\n\r\nThank you to all the contributors who brought this issue up! We have opted for this approach, but we genuinely appreciate your contributions. \ud83d\ude01 \r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nAdded the imports signal, and sys in for signal and sys.exit() to work. The code adds a signal handler that is called when Control-C is execute, and checks if y -N is currently running. If it is, the code sets N to 0, and continues. However, if N is already 0, meaning the user just wants to stop the program, the program is executed normally.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nI added a comment defining what my new function does.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nI have tested this functionality with and without y -N, and both have worked as intended.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

Git submodule will always update to latest version of `main` relative to the primary repo. \r\n\r\nThis means that as long as we update our git submodules on merges into `master`, we will always be able to keep our cassettes in sync and even if we need to run older tests on older commits.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- [x] Move all the cassettes to one directory\r\n- [x] Move to git submodule\r\n- [x] Update CI to work with cassettes git submodule \r\n- [x] Make sure we are handling updating of git submodules correctly when we switch branches (tap into git hooks)\r\n- [x] Ensure on merge to master that we update `tests/cassettes` git submodule (delete old update code)\r\n- [ ] Ensure somewhere in the install process that we create the symbolic link so devs can take advantage of `post-checkout` commit hook.  `ln -s hooks/post-checkout .git/hooks/post-checkout`\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/4284\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes. <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n- [x] I have run `black .` and `isort .` against my code to ensure it passes our linter.\r\n\r\n",

Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nWhen developing and using plugins it is onerous to download a zip file manually and to download a new zip file each time the source changes. It also makes it difficult to inspect and make changes to plugins if they're not working right (e.g. the recent change to `AutoGPTPluginTemplate` which broke all plugins).\r\n\r\nA solution which seems straightforward is to allow directories in the `plugins` directory. Each directory can be either a normal directory or, importantly, a cloned github repo. This makes it easier for 3rd party plugins to be used without being part of the official plugin repository.\r\n\r\nIt also includes changes to plugin dependencies in that now each plugin has the ability to have its own requirements.txt file. Now, all plugins don't need to share the same dependency list, and you only install dependencies of plugins you actually will use. This was necessary to support directory plugins as their requirements couldn't be installed otherwise.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n- Add directory-based plugin support when loading plugins\r\n- Add directory-based plugin support when installing plugin dependencies\r\n- Necessary test changes to accommodate\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n- A little bit of inline comments, but significant documentation changes would need to be made to the plugins repo documentation if/when this is merged. I can take care of that.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\n- Created my own plugin and tested it in a directory\r\n- Split out plugins that I want from the main plugins repo and using them as directories\r\n- Adding a directory-based plugin into the unit tests\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes. <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n- [x] I have run the following commands against my code to ensure it passes our linters:\r\n    ```shell\r\n    black .\r\n    isort .\r\n    mypy\r\n    autoflake --remove-all-unused-imports --recursive --ignore-init-module-imports autogpt tests --in-place\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

This makes container start-up way way faster.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request.

Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nWhen running Auto-GPT it very, very frequently wants to run python code. To do it is usually 3 steps (execute file [that probably does not exist], write file, execute file). Not only is this quite costly, but if there are errors in the code (there usually are), the iteration cycle to fix it is slow and extremely error prone.\r\n\r\nThis change adds a new command, `execute_python_code`, which will execute straight python code. It does this by writing the code to a file in the workspace directory, executing it _using the existing `execute_python_file` command_, and then returning the results. The file is kept around for later reference.\r\n\r\nI know that we're limiting the number of new commands we have, but this one is a 200%+ increase in efficiency for the majority of tasks that Auto-GPT decides to do.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request.

This results in file not found error output and in turn results in Auto-GPT looping around this command.\r\n\r\nA partial solution was to get a heavier docker-image, but this still leaves out a lot of libraries.\r\n\r\nMy attempt is to have the docker container install all needed libraries and dependencies required to run the requested file. \r\n\r\nThis was pretty easy for straighforward import statements, but not statements are equal to the library name while installing. \r\nAlso libraries that are already built into the given docker image will result in an error output.\r\nLastly there are imports that need dependencies that require non-python code (ta-lib, pyplot) and this needs an apt get command for those dependencies.\r\n\r\nMy unfinished attempt now is able to succesfully run pip installable import statements. Also i was working on apt get commands for the required non-python libraries.\r\n\r\nAt this point i am not sure how to move forward on this and need help from more experienced coders.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nExecute_code.py has been changed much. this is the only change\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation.

This is the second security issue i discovered in this one function. That combined with the quality of the implementation warranted a rewrite.\r\n\r\n`ALLOW_COMMANDS` and `DENY_COMMANDS` is very confusing currently. It's not clear from the names that they're referring to *shell* commands and not Auto-GPT commands. It's also not clear which takes precedence, and in what order they apply.\r\n\r\nThis change makes it clear that there are two different strategies: allowlist (aka whitelist) or denylist (aka blacklist). Each strategy gets its own variable for its list and there is another variable saying which one to use.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n- Add `shell_command_control` config variable\r\n- Rename `allow_commands` to `shell_allowlist`, ensuring backwards-compatibility\r\n- Rename `deny_commands` to `shell_denylist`, ensuring backwards-compatibility\r\n- Adjust `validate_command` to match. Simplify it too.\r\n- Add a bunch of tests\r\n- Improve .env.template documentation\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation.

            "body": "### Background\r\nThis pull request introduces a new approach to managing the context length when calling the chat completion API to get a running message of previous events in the MessageHistory class. The improvements include processing new events in batches and summarizing them before appending to the existing summary. These changes aim to address the issue where the context length exceeds the model's maximum token limit (4097 tokens for gpt-3.5-turbo).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n1. Batch Processing of New Events in **update_running_summary** function: To manage the context length and avoid exceeding the maximum token limit, new events are now processed in batches. Each batch's size is determined by the token length limit of the language model. This ensures that the length of the context stays within the allowable limit, avoiding the associated error.\r\n2. Introduction of **summarize_batch** Function: This function handles the summarization of each batch of new events. It receives the batch of new events and the configuration object, logs the prompt to the current log cycle, obtains a summarized message of combining the previous summary and new events in the current batch using the create_chat_completion function, and then updates the summary. The updated summary is also logged in the current log cycle. This approach can keep the context across batches of events because each summarization includes the previous summary and new events.\r\n\r\nThe changes in this pull request provide a robust solution to manage context length and ensure the agent's memory and conversational context are effectively handled. It mitigates the error of exceeding the model's maximum context length, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the AI assistant.\r\n\r\nThis can fix #4634, fix #4019, fix #4012, fix #3979, fix #3681 issues\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nDetailed comments are added to the code, along with some future enhancements marked as To-Do.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nAdded a new test for MessageHistory class to test the batch running summary code by mocking lot of events in the message history and trimming most of the messages.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes. <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n- [x] I have run the following commands against my code to ensure it passes our linters:\r\n    ```shell\r\n    black .\r\n    isort .\r\n    mypy\r\n    autoflake --remove-all-unused-imports --recursive --ignore-init-module-imports --ignore-pass-after-docstring autogpt tests --in-place\r\n    ```",

Turns out there were two issues:\r\n\r\nThe JSON coming from OpenAI is actually not JSON. It's a Python Dict that's been stringified like `str(dict)`.\r\n\r\nThe second issue is that we weren't correctly feeding the AI the JSON schema. It recognizes the same schema that we use to validate the response, so this works much better.\r\n\r\nThis may also fix the \"no command given\" errors but I will need to test more.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n- Use `ast.literal_eval` to reverse the `str()` process that was done by OpenAI\r\n- Update the prompt to include the exact JSON schema\r\n- Remove a ton of now-useless code\r\n- Catch and log errors better\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\n- Tested a bunch locally\r\n- Multiple challenge runs\r\n- Added json validation tests\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes. <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n- [x] I have run the following commands against my code to ensure it passes our linters:\r\n    ```shell\r\n    black .\r\n    isort .\r\n    mypy\r\n    autoflake --remove-all-unused-imports --recursive --ignore-init-module-imports --ignore-pass-after-docstring autogpt tests --in-place\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

The goal of this approach is to prevent the total token count from exceeding the model's maximum limit when new events are being processed. While this method accounted for the token length of new events and the summarization prompt, it failed to consider the length of the current summary.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nIn the modified version, a summary_tlength variable has been introduced in the update_running_summary function. This variable holds the token length of the current summary, ensuring the total token count of three components: 1) the current summary, 2) the new events, and 3) the summarization prompt, does not surpass the maximum token limit imposed by the model.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nReran the tests and passed.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [ ] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes. <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n- [x] I have run the following commands against my code to ensure it passes our linters:\r\n    ```shell\r\n    black .\r\n    isort .\r\n    mypy\r\n    autoflake --remove-all-unused-imports --recursive --ignore-init-module-imports --ignore-pass-after-docstring autogpt tests --in-place\r\n    ```",

Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nCurrently the way to configure which plugins to use is to change `ALLOWLISTED_PLUGINS` / `DENYLISTED_PLUGINS` in .env.\r\nThe only way to configure a plugin is through the same .env file.\r\n\r\nThis change adds a plugin config file, `plugins_config.yaml` which allows plugins to be enabled and disabled (replacing the old allowlist/denylist). It also allows arbitrary config per plugin, such as API keys or model names or whatever that plugin needs. Now, plugins don't need their own env variables.\r\n\r\nI made significant effort for this to be backwards-compatible. On start-up, if the plugins settings file isn't found, it will create a config file derived on the old `ALLOWLISTED_PLUGINS` / `DENYLISTED_PLUGINS` env variables.\r\n\r\nConfiguration for old plugins won't need to be changed immediately, they can still use whatever env variables they wanted. The plugin author can decide whether to use env variables or the plugins config file. We should encourage using the plugins config file, though.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n- Remove use of allowlist / denylist for plugins, updating those checks to use the plugin config `enabled` value\r\n- Add plugin config classes\r\n- Load plugin config from file, creating one if necessary\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n- In-code comments\r\n- Updated `options.md` with new/removed vars\r\n- Updated `plugins.md` with the config file details\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality.

            "body": "## This PR implements OpenAI functions support\r\n\r\nYou can now provide the AI with a list of functions that it can call. When making a chat completion request, there is now a separate data structure containing that list. In the response, you will receive a function call in a distinct data structure, separate from the textual content of the response. This enables easy handling of function calls alongside the text response.\r\n\r\nThis is extremely convenient for us!\r\n\r\n## This is a very large PR. Here's why\r\n\r\nPreviously our interaction with AI was `text`-in and `text`-out. Now it is `(text+function list)`-in and `(text+function call)` out. Passing a string everywhere just doesn't work anymore.\r\n\r\nWe needed to change:\r\n- How commands are defined to give the metadata that functions need\r\n- How commands are executed\r\n- How we parse responses now that we don't need to hack the command out of them\r\n- Our prompts so that they didn't need to reference commands anymore\r\n- The model-related code to only support models that are functions-compliant\r\n- How we keep track of our message cycle\r\n- How we keep track of history\r\n- All of the data structures related to messages (there are now twice as many fields in a message)\r\n- All of the calls involving chat completions and AI interactions\r\n- Message roles to add the function role\r\n\r\nDue to those **I also had to disable most of the non-essential commands**. The way that the AI thinks about commands has changed dramatically and it's going to take testing of the commands one-by-one to make sure that they work in this new world. I couldn't do it in one go otherwise this already-massive PR would be twice as big and take four times longer.\r\n\r\nEDIT: the PR's size has been reduced by merging bits by bits into master.",

Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nThere were a few more calls to config() in the codebase.\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n- removed remaining calls to config()\r\n- removed config being a singleton. This means it's not allowed to call it initialize it twice in the autogpt folder. (we still initialize it once in pytest.\r\n- removed flaky because it's slowing down the pipeline: a flaky challenge should be discarded from the pipeline anyway, there is no point keeping it.\r\n- the service unavailable 503 error is a new error OpenAI has been giving recently, we want to retry that so it's been added to the retry_api decorator.\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality.

IMO we should be working together not separately.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Includes LangChain dependency, moving us away from being a LangChain alternative (if that's what we want to do)\r\n- We need to be vigilant of tool changes in LangChain to make sure that Auto-GPT can use those tools as effectively as before. Freezing the pip version helps mitigate this somewhat.\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n- Adds class method to `Command` to create a command and generate the wrappers for it\r\n- Adds the `file_search` tool as an example of how it would work, including the arg converter",

To test this feature's performance in Auto-GPT, I've incorporated a toggle for function calls, `ENABLE_FUNCTION_CALLING`.\r\n\r\n- When `ENABLE_FUNCTION_CALLING` is set to False, Auto-GPT operates as usual.\r\n- When `ENABLE_FUNCTION_CALLING` is set to True and `FAST_LLM_MODEL` corresponds to a model updated as of June 13th with a function calling ability (such as 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0613' or 'gpt-4-0613'), function calls are executed.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n1. Added Enable Function Calling Feature  \r\nI have introduced a new environmental variable ENABLE_FUNCTION_CALLING in .env.template which can be set to enable function calling. It is False by default.\r\n\r\n2. Modified create_chat_completion method  \r\nIn the create_chat_completion method in autogpt/llm/utils/__init__.py, a new parameter functions has been added. The method now also checks if function calling is enabled and if so, adds the raw functions to chat_completion_kwargs.\r\n\r\n3. Updated Prompt Generator  \r\nThe prompt generator in autogpt/prompts/generator.py has been updated to generate different prompts based on whether function calling is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n- I confirmed that pytest passed all tests, except for the following error, when `ENABLE_FUNCTION_CALLING=True`, `FAST_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4-0613`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFAILED tests/unit/test_config.py::test_initial_values - AssertionError: assert 'gpt-4-0613' == 'gpt-3.5-turbo'\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note that 'pytest' almost always fail with 'gpt-3.5-turbo', as the 'args' of the command are not included in the OpenAI API responses.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [ ] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [ ] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [ ] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes. <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n- [x] I have run the following commands against my code to ensure it passes our linters:\r\n    ```shell\r\n    black .\r\n    isort .\r\n    mypy\r\n    autoflake --remove-all-unused-imports --recursive --ignore-init-module-imports --ignore-pass-after-docstring autogpt tests --in-place\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

When one of the two exceptions occurs, Auto-GPT checks if the HTTP status code of that exception is 429, 502, 503, or if the default number of retry attempts (num_attempts) has been reached. If so, it rethrows (raises) the exception.\r\n\r\nHowever, when specific exceptions such as `APIError` and `Timeout` occur, the HTTP status code can not become 503. [The HTTP status code becomes 503 only when a ServiceUnavailableError occurs.](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/openai/api_requestor.py#L744) Therefore, I added the process to handle the occurrence of `ServiceUnavailableError`.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation.

It splits up the requirements file into dist, dist_extra, dev and test. - all are included in requirements.txt but only dist is included in pyproject.toml. I considered putting the requirements files in a sub-folder, but I wasn't sure what other build/CI processes might break\r\n2. It sanitizes requirements_dist.txt to get rid of Pypi-unsupported features like direct references (HTTP, git+, etc)\r\n3. It adds a script entry point (autogpt) - that will install as a command that users to use post-install directly from the command line.\r\n4. It fixes the package files that would get installed directly in the site-packages directory, potentially overwriting other package files, or being overwritten later on. The main issue here is that we don't have an src or autogpt subdirectory, so they are getting installed one level up. In the future, it may make sense to move most files into the autogpt folder.\r\n\r\n### TODO:\r\n- Gain access to PyPI and TestPypi to update the packages (I've reached out to @Torantulino \r\n- Update the documentation \r\n- Test\r\n- Push to Pypi\r\n- Build via CI\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nDocs will be updated once the general direction above is agreed upon.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [ ] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [ ] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [ ] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [ ] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [ ] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes. <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n- [ ] I have run the following commands against my code to ensure it passes our linters:\r\n    ```shell\r\n    black .\r\n    isort .\r\n    mypy\r\n    autoflake --remove-all-unused-imports --recursive --ignore-init-module-imports --ignore-pass-after-docstring autogpt tests --in-place\r\n    ```\r\n",

Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nAll the changes are in the `execute_python_file` function, which needs to detect if imported modules need to be installed thanks to a simple regex `findall()`.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nWhen you execute execute_python_code command:\r\n1. Make a file `requirements.txt` if there are imported modules thanks to a regex to detect modules to install with pip\r\n2. Make a `Dockerfile` to install these `requirements.txt` modules\r\n3. Execute the image build thanks to the `Dockerfile`, otherwise execute python3 alpine image.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality.

To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nCheck out our [wiki page on Contributing](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Nexus/wiki/Contributing)\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nThis PR is intended to fix the errors at the following URL.\r\nhttps://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/actions/runs/5461866933\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nAs can be seen in the URL below, an error occurs during the `__init__` process of the `api_requestor` in the openai library, within `original_init` in `tests/vcr/__init__.py`.\r\nhttps://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/actions/runs/5461866933/jobs/9940430084#step:7:202\r\n\r\nThis seems to be because `config` defined as a pytest.fixture in the `tests/conftest.py` is not being called during the execution of the pytest, causing `os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]` to become `None`. So, modifying files, as shown below, will resolve this issue.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@challenge()\r\ndef test_write_file(\r\n+   config: Config,  # or agent: Agent\r\n    patched_api_requestor: None,\r\n    monkeypatch: pytest.MonkeyPatch,\r\n    level_to_run: int,\r\n    challenge_name: str,\r\n    workspace: Workspace,\r\n    patched_make_workspace: pytest.fixture,\r\n) -> None:\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nI performed the following pytests.\r\n```bash\r\n$ PROXY=\"http://localhost:8080\" pytest -n auto --record-mode=all tests/challenges/basic_abilities/test_write_file.py\r\n$ PROXY=\"http://localhost:8080\" pytest -n auto --record-mode=all tests/challenges/memory/test_memory_challenge_a.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nDue to this commit, the error changed from \r\n\r\n```\r\nFAILED tests/challenges/basic_abilities/test_write_file.py::test_write_file - openai.error.AuthenticationError: No API key provided.

            "body": "### Background\r\nWe introduced a reliance on setting openai module attributes a couple of months ago to verify model access.  This was causing breakages in Azure usage not fixed by #4875 or #4098.\r\n\r\n**Known Issue**: We have default fallbacks when gpt4 is not available (use gpt-3.5-turbo), but azure deployments can modify the names of models and there are no guarantees that a system will have gpt3.5 if it doesn't have gpt4.  I think this is mostly a non-issue as someone using azure wants their model to fail on misconfiguration as this is most likely a user error.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Pass in credentials when we check for model validity.\r\n- Put azure resolution of --gpt3only and --gpt4only on the same path.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nCI\r\n\r\nManual testing of `./run.sh` with no flags, with --gpt3only flag and with --gpt4only flag on an azure instance.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes. <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n- [x] I have run the following commands against my code to ensure it passes our linters:\r\n    ```shell\r\n    black .\r\n    isort .\r\n    mypy\r\n    autoflake --remove-all-unused-imports --recursive --ignore-init-module-imports --ignore-pass-after-docstring autogpt tests --in-place\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nCheck out our [wiki page on Contributing](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Nexus/wiki/Contributing)\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n`config.py` had a fictitious name, Colorama.Fore.ORANGE, which does not exist according to [The Current PyPi Page for Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/). This was discussed with the maintainers and the change was approved.  \r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nI have changed it from Fore.ORANGE ---> Fore.YELLOW. Yellow is a common color for warning messages, which the Fore is applied to, so it is still clear.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nChange is very small, I don't belive this is applicable.\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nBefore, when `run.sh` was run, it would produce a fatal error, `\"AttributeError: 'Ansifore' Object has no attribute 'ORANGE' `. This has been eliminated, since the name was fictitious, and now it has been changed to something that exists within the `colorama` module. The probability of this bug re-emerging is low.\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [Yes] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [ Yes ] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [ Yes ] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [ Yes ] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [ Yes ] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes. <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n- [ Yes ] I have run the following commands against my code to ensure it passes our linters:\r\n    ```shell\r\n    black .\r\n    isort .\r\n    mypy\r\n    autoflake --remove-all-unused-imports --recursive --ignore-init-module-imports --ignore-pass-after-docstring autogpt tests --in-place\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

This distracts from the core operations of the Agent. This is a first pass to try to at least crudely separate application concerns from the agent logic.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Lift getting/parsing user input out of the agent\r\n- Lift all calls to logger.typewriter_log (UI updates) out of the agent\r\n- Lift user signal handling out of the agent\r\n- Lift the Spinner UI context manager out of the agent\r\n- Add a `run_interaction_loop` function to `main.py` that does all of the above.\r\n\r\n#### Updates to the agent interface\r\nSince the agent now has no method to run forever, it's step is split along boundaries where we either want to start some UI element or we want to interact with the user.\r\n\r\n- `on_before_think` now is called directly by the main loop and returns the prompt.\r\n- `think` consists of interacting with the language model and parsing the response, which is now returned to the main loop\r\n- `execute` has been split out as a separate method (from inside `parse_and_process_response` which now just parses and processes the response). \r\n- `execute` is now invoked by the main loop \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThis is primarily code motion, so I've not documented existing things except to add typing.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nCI + manual runs.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes. <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n- [x] I have run the following commands against my code to ensure it passes our linters:\r\n    ```shell\r\n    black .\r\n    isort .\r\n    mypy\r\n    autoflake --remove-all-unused-imports --recursive --ignore-init-module-imports --ignore-pass-after-docstring autogpt tests --in-place\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

This allows us to pause the UI spinning, send a message to the user, and then resume the UI spinning.  Otherwise anything logged in the SIGINT handler gets garbled by the Spinner execution.\r\n- Pull the user update functionality into an `update_user` function.  \r\n- Pull the user input functionality into a `get_user_feedback` function.  Use an enum for feedback types.\r\n- Fix the cycle budget logic.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nDocstrings and comments.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nA bunch of manual testing.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes. <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n- [x] I have run the following commands against my code to ensure it passes our linters:\r\n    ```shell\r\n    black .\r\n    isort .\r\n    mypy\r\n    autoflake --remove-all-unused-imports --recursive --ignore-init-module-imports --ignore-pass-after-docstring autogpt tests --in-place\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

Goals:\r\n\r\n- Move all application code (code with user interaction or code that is responsible for application logic like running the agent loop) into the `autogpt.app` subpackage\r\n- Make sure no code outside `autogpt.app` references code inside `autogpt.app` (The app depends on the library but not the other way around).\r\n- Make sure no code outside of `autogpt.app` references `logger.typewriter_log` (our defacto UI tool).\r\n\r\nThis is an almost complete success.  The only code that imports from `autogpt.app` is test code (fine, we can segregate test suites later).  There is one instance of an invocation of `logger.typewriter_log` in the creation of the default prompt generator which would have required much more in depth changes than moving files or functions between files, so I left it for a separate PR.\r\n\r\n**This doesn't make the app code clean.** It's pretty much a disaster in there.  But now it's a disaster all in one pile that we can carefully sort through.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- `autogpt.cli` -> `autogpt.app.cli`\r\n- `autogpt.configurator` -> `autogpt.app.configurator`\r\n- `autogpt.main` -> `autogpt.app.main`\r\n- `autogpt.main.COMMAND_CATEGORIES` -> `autogpt.commands.COMMAND_CATEGORIES`\r\n- `autogpt.llm.utils.check_model` -> `autogpt.app.configurator.check_model`\r\n- `autogpt.logs.utils.*` -> `autogpt.app.main.*`\r\n- `autogpt.prompts.prompt.construct_main_ai_config` -> `autogpt.app.main.construct_main_ai_config`\r\n- Remove top level `main.py`\r\n- Remove top level `tests.py`\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nX\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nCI + Manual testing\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [X] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [X] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [X] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [ ] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [X] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes. <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n- [X] I have run the following commands against my code to ensure it passes our linters:\r\n    ```shell\r\n    black .\r\n    isort .\r\n    mypy\r\n    autoflake --remove-all-unused-imports --recursive --ignore-init-module-imports --ignore-pass-after-docstring autogpt tests --in-place\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

We also started adding the protocol support to agents like [smol developer](https://github.com/smol-ai/developer), [beebot](https://github.com/AutoPackAI/beebot) and [babyagi](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi).\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned, the spec is minimal \u2014 we plan to support workspaces/artifacts and other functionality, but the core has to be usable and make sense, that's why we are starting with a minimal spec and plan to iteratively add more.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nI made changes to the `cli_web_app` runner that was not actively developed \u2014 I reused the original CLI methods and let the user start a server via the `agent-protocol` package.\r\n\r\nThe user can then interact (this is the minimal interaction) with the API via `POST /tasks` for creating a task that AutoGPT should run and `POST /agent/tasks/{task_id}/steps` for a repeated execution of steps from the AutoGPT loop while optionally adding `user_input` that the execution can process. \r\nFor this, I used a modified `run_interaction_loop` function that only executes one step of the loop and waits for another API `POST /agent/tasks/{task_id}/steps` request to continue.\r\n\r\nNow the next step is to implement calling this API via a CLI as was the original plan of the CLI web app runner.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation.

This PR adds two related functions:\r\n1. ask_user, which takes a list of prompts and asks them to the user one-by-one\r\n2. execute_interactive_shell, which extends the functionality fo \"execute_shell\" by allowing for commands that need to get input from the user.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a very common task is to check if a file exists (some prompting methods use this to prevent agent loops. However, the LLM uses the `list_files` command, which works but isn't efficient, or some sort of shell script like ` if [ -f <file> ]; then echo \"False\"; else echo \"True\"; fi`, which is better, but involves launching a shell.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds \"exists\", which uses one-line native Python to check whether files and folders exist.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nAdded the following commands:\r\n\r\n**File commands**:\r\n- exists\r\n\r\n**Execute commands*:\r\n- execute_interactive_shell\r\n- ask_user\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nLocal testing, and some unit tests\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [X] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [X] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [X] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [X] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [X] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes. <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n- [X] I have run the following commands against my code to ensure it passes our linters:\r\n    ```shell\r\n    black .\r\n    isort .\r\n    mypy\r\n    autoflake --remove-all-unused-imports --recursive --ignore-init-module-imports --ignore-pass-after-docstring autogpt tests --in-place\r\n    ```",

It introduces new data models, methods, and properties that align with the changed logic. The PR is a part of our efforts to make the benchmarking process more efficient and user-friendly.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- **New Data Models**: Introduced `BenchmarkStepRequestBody` and `BenchmarkTaskRequestBody` classes to better encapsulate the properties needed for benchmark tasks and steps.\r\n- **Update Benchmark Base URL**: Modified the `_benchmarkBaseUrl` in `RestApiUtility` to reflect the latest endpoint changes.\r\n- **Remove Unused Code**: Removed the `ReportRequestBody` class as it's no longer used in the new implementation.\r\n- **New Service Methods**: Added `createBenchmarkTask`, `executeBenchmarkStep`, and `triggerEvaluation` methods in the `BenchmarkService` class.\r\n- **SkillNodeData Update**: Added an `evalId` property to the `SkillNodeData` object to support the new benchmarking requirements.\r\n- **Refactor `runBenchmark` Method**: Refactored the `runBenchmark` method in `SkillTreeViewModel` to use the newly introduced classes and methods.\r\n\r\nThese changes are integral to the new benchmarking workflow and pave the way for future enhancements.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Scorecard \u2728\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nCheck out our contribution guide:\r\nhttps://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Nexus/wiki/Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
