My assumption however is that the function arguments `start` and `end` are both inclusive \r\n\r\n```js\r\ninitializeArrayWithRange(5) //-> [0,1,2,3,4,5]\r\ninitializeArrayWithRange(7, 3) //-> [3,4,5,6,7]\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->\r\n\r\n### Current Snippet Behavior\r\nHowever that is not the case and when the arrayRange gets initialized only the start is initialized with the array\r\n```js\r\nconst initializeArrayWithRange = (end, start = 0) =>\r\n  Array.from({ length: end - start }).map((v, i) => i + start);\r\n// initializeArrayWithRange(5) -> [0,1,2,3,4]\r\n// initializeArrayWithRange(7, 3) -> [3,4,5,6]\r\n```\r\n<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->\r\n\r\n### Possible Solution\r\nSimple `(end + 1)` fix should do the trick\r\n```js\r\nconst initializeArrayWithRange = (end, start = 0) =>\r\n  Array.from({ length: (end + 1) - start }).map((v, i) => i + start);\r\n// initializeArrayWithRange(5) -> [0,1,2,3,4,5]\r\n// initializeArrayWithRange(7, 3) -> [3,4,5,6,7]\r\n\r\n```\r\n## *PR fix/Update*\r\n### initializeArrayWithRange\r\n\r\nInitializes an array containing the numbers in the specified range where `start` and `end` are inclusive.\r\n\r\nUse `Array((end + 1) - start)` to create an array of the desired length, `Array.map()` to fill with the desired values in a range.\r\nYou can omit `start` to use a default value of `0`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst initializeArrayWithRange = (end, start = 0) => \r\n  Array.from({ length: (end + 1) - start }).map((v, i) => i + start);\r\n// initializeArrayWithRange(5) -> [0,1,2,3,4,5]\r\n// initializeArrayWithRange(7, 3) -> [3,4,5,6,7]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs described in #252 \r\n",

The rest operator is used to collect all the remaining argument of the function. So instead of taking the whole list and then popping the first element (this is expensive), we simply retain the first argument as a variable `first` and the rest of the arguments are stored as array in `rest` variable. Then we just change the order of arguments.\r\n\r\nI think this code is easy to grok and is much faster and more ES6.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst flip = fn => (first, ...rest) => fn(...rest, first);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote - \r\nIntentionally used the word `rest` instead of `args` because I felt for this case rest better helps people understand that , rest holds all the args after first arg. If I have used `args` then it partly implies that first is not an arg which is not true\r\n[flip function](https://30secondsofcode.org/#flip)\r\n<!--- Provide a link to the method your trying to [ADD] or [UPDATE] in the Description -->\r\n\r\n## What does your PR belong to?\r\n- [ ] Website\r\n- [x] Snippets\r\n- [ ] General / Things regarding the repository (like CI Integration)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (non-breaking improvement of a snippet)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n\r\n## [Lodash Backlog](https://github.com/Chalarangelo/30-seconds-of-code/issues/100)\r\n<!--- Provide a link to the method your trying to [ADD] or [UPDATE] in the Description above -->\r\n<!--- Add the prefix [UPDATE: `method.md`] or [ADD: `method.md`] to the Title & Desciption -->\r\n- [x] I added the prefix [UPDATE: `method.md`] or [ADD: `method.md`]\r\n- [ ] I have referenced the `method` to the lodash backlog.\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.

The `search` was running slowly (~1 second per `keyup` event) due to forced reflows caused by alternating style reads and writes for each iteration of its internal loops. For example, on each iteration through the loop of snippet nodes, there was a style read due to calling `x.innerText` on a DOM node, then a style write due to `x.style.display = ...`. This forced a reflow on each time through the loop, slowing down the total time taken to search through all nodes for matches. This profile depicts one call of `search` with the argument `\"if\"` prior to the fix.\r\n\r\n![before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12390642/37302278-ac1918ea-25f0-11e8-814a-63761c2665bc.jpeg)\r\n\r\nInstead, replacing `x.innerText` with `x.textContent` avoids forced reflows and allows the browser to batch all style updates when the loop finishes. This profile shows the same call to `search` as above, but without the intermediate reflows:\r\n\r\n![after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12390642/37302485-4af49ea8-25f1-11e8-99b6-7a6fadbf6283.jpeg)\r\n\r\nI found that this change removed the noticeable delay between typing a character and seeing the updated list of results. \r\n\r\n## What does your PR belong to?\r\n- [x] Website\r\n- [ ] Snippets\r\n- [ ] General / Things regarding the repository (like CI Integration)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (non-breaking improvement of a snippet)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.

Minor performance increase (8.3s -> 7.8s). \r\n- Updated `module.js` to cut down the number of I/O operations. Reasonable performance increase (7.8s -> 5.1s).\r\n- Updated `module.js` to output a full (snippets + archive) `_30s.js` file in `test`. Negligible performance impact.\r\n- Made `module.js` skip bundles when running on non-CRON/API builds. Performance for the test package seems to be ~52ms on my machine, which should be pretty good for running tests on commits.\r\n- Updated `tdd.js` to follow the structure discussed above, updated all `.test.js` files, fixed a few failing tests, cleaned up orphaned tests etc. Overall performance is about the same, maybe we managed to earn ourselves a second or two.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n- [ ] Snippets, Tests & Tags (new snippets, updated snippets, re-tagging of snippets, added/updated tests)\r\n- [x] Scripts & Website & Meta (anything related to files in the [scripts folder](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code/tree/master/scripts), how the repository's automated procedures work and the website)\r\n- [ ] Glossary & Secondary Features (anything related to the glossary, such as new or updated terms or other secondary features)\r\n- [ ] General, Typos, Misc. & Meta (everything else, typos, general stuff and meta files in the repository - e.g. the issue template)\r\n\r\n## Guidelines\r\n- [x] I have read the guidelines in the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document.\r\n- [x] My PR doesn't include any `testlog` changes. \r\n",

I know that negative zero doesn't exist in real Math but this is just how JavaScript engine threats it. Whenever JavaScript engine works with dividing negatives, it treats them as positives and adds `-` afterward.\r\n\r\n#### Usage\r\nNot much as you've guessed it but this function can be used when writing complex animations, a `-0` on just finished animation can provide information on whether the animation was coming from the right or the left side etc. \r\n\r\n#### Note about tests\r\nI wrote the tests, they don't pass due to the way they work. In order to make them work the `_30s` needs `isNegativeZero` module in it.

In busy processes, the programmer is strongly encouraged to use the asynchronous versions of these calls. \r\nThe synchronous versions will block the entire process until they complete \u2014 halting all connections.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, updated `module.js` script.

By default, Jest tests complete once they reach the end of their execution. If there are assertions on asynchronous code, but we don't make Jest aware of it, those tests will simply pass.\r\n\r\nThere are specific ways to make Jest wait for expectations:\r\n\r\nFor callback-based code, we can introduce the `done` argument on each test. This is a callback function provided by Jest. Each test will wait for this callback to be executed after the desired assertions are done. If the `done` callback is not invoked, the test will timeout.\r\n\r\nFor promise-based code, we can simply return the promise from the test and use run the expectations on the `then`. Or we can use the `resolves` / `rejects` helpers.\r\n\r\nFinally, we can use also async / await, by making the test closure async, and using await get the values to do the expectations.\r\n\r\nMore details about this on the [official docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/asynchronous).\r\n \r\n<!-- Write a detailed description of your changes/additions here -->\r\n<!-- If your PR resolves an issue, please state \"Resolves #(issue number)\" to help maintainers process it faster -->\r\n<!-- If you think your PR will cause breaking changes, require changes in the documentation etc, please be so kind as to explain what, where and how -->\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n- [x] Snippets, Tests & Tags (new snippets, updated snippets, re-tagging of snippets, added/updated tests)\r\n- [ ] Scripts & Website & Meta (anything related to files in the [scripts folder](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code/tree/master/scripts), how the repository's automated procedures work and the website)\r\n- [ ] Glossary & Secondary Features (anything related to the glossary, such as new or updated terms or other secondary features)\r\n- [ ] General, Typos, Misc. & Meta (everything else, typos, general stuff and meta files in the repository - e.g. the issue template)\r\n\r\n## Guidelines\r\n- [x] I have read the guidelines in the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document.\r\n",

Unfortunately current implementation of it fails for a particular case:\r\n(Where one key is prefix of another and it has object value, in this case `b` & `b.c`)\r\n```\r\nlet obj = {\r\n  'a': 1,\r\n  'b': { 'e': 4 },\r\n  'b.c': 5\r\n};\r\n\r\nhasKey(obj, 'b.c');\r\n// should return \"true\" but returns \"false\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above scenario can not be handled with current method signature of accepting second argument as string. Using function signature where it accepts Array of keys, we can address above scenario along with other simpler cases.\r\n\r\nThis also simplifies overall implementation of function without using any recursion or string manipulations. With Array as key list, we can use `Array.prototype.every()` to simplify and early return on failure.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<!-- If your PR resolves an issue, please state \"Resolves #(issue number)\" to help maintainers process it faster -->\r\nThis PR updates [hasKey](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code#haskey) snippet to handle this failing cases along with existing ones and simplifies overall implementation of the function.\r\n<!-- If you think your PR will cause breaking changes, require changes in the documentation etc, please be so kind as to explain what, where and how -->\r\nThis changes signature of [hasKey](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code#haskey) snippet to accept list of strings instead of just a string, which can be called as a breaking change.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n- [x] Snippets, Tests & Tags (new snippets, updated snippets, re-tagging of snippets, added/updated tests)\r\n- [ ] Tools, Scripts & Automation (anything related to files in the scripts folder, Gatsby, website, Travis CI or Netlify)\r\n- [ ] General, Typos, Misc. & Meta (everything related to content, typos, general stuff and meta files in the repository - e.g. the issue template)\r\n- [ ] Other (please specifiy in the description above)\r\n\r\n## Guidelines\r\n- [x] I have read the guidelines in the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document.\r\n",

The current code fails to restore nested properties and doesnot cater for scenairos like\r\n```js\r\nunflattenObject({ 'a.b': 1, 'a.c': 2, d: 3 })\r\nunflattenObject({ 'a.b': 'foo', d: 3 })\r\n```\r\nwhere either the same key is being refered more than once or the values are non numbers. More detials can be seen in [this](https://runkit.com/tbasse/5f2a9929c9b5c9001a4d3a6e) runkit shared in the issue as well.\r\n\r\nAn additional scenario which the code failed to handle was when the flat path reffered to particular indices in the arrays values against a key. For example.\r\n```js\r\nunflattenObject({ 'a.b.0': 5, d: 3 })\r\n```\r\nshould return something like `{a:{b:[5]}, d: 3}`. However, the code fails to compile.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\nI fixed the snippet to handle these scenarios along with some improvements. The updated code which passes all these tests can be seen in [this](https://runkit.com/taimoor0217/unflattenobject) runkit.\r\n\r\n**Modifications / Improvements**\r\n\r\nThe previous code uses `JSON.parse()` to parse the manually built string into JSON and then merges it with the accumulator using `Object.assign()`. This happened for ever iteration of `Array.prototype.reduce()`. My code takes a slightly different approach of making the reference to the values as the next accumulator. This ways, I can directly mutate and nested objects without having to merge on each iteration. This arguably improves the performance fo the code.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Then the smaller array is iterated on with a lookup search on the hashMap object.\r\n\r\nThe worst case complexity of the new algorithm is O(n).\r\n\r\n[isContainedInOld vs isContainedInNew](https://perf.link/#eyJpZCI6IjA3dm01NWRnemtnIiwidGl0bGUiOiJGaW5kaW5nIG51bWJlcnMgaW4gYW4gYXJyYXkgb2YgMTAwMCIsImJlZm9yZSI6ImNvbnN0IGRlbW8xID0gWy4uLkFycmF5KDEwMDApLmtleXMoKV07XG5jb25zdCBkZW1vMiA9IFsuLi5BcnJheSg5MDApLmtleXMoKV07XG5cbmNvbnN0IGlzQ29udGFpbmVkSW5PbGQgPSAoYSwgYikgPT4ge1xuICBmb3IgKGNvbnN0IHYgb2YgbmV3IFNldChhKSkge1xuICAgIGlmICghYi5zb21lKGUgPT4gZSA9PT0gdikgfHwgYS5maWx0ZXIoZSA9PiBlID09PSB2KS5sZW5ndGggPiBiLmZpbHRlcihlID0%2BIGUgPT09IHYpLmxlbmd0aClcbiAgICAgIHJldHVybiBmYWxzZTtcbiAgfVxuICByZXR1cm4gdHJ1ZTtcbn07XG5cbmNvbnN0IGlzQ29udGFpbmVkSW5OZXcgPSAoYSwgYikgPT4ge1xuICBpZiAoYS5sZW5ndGggIT09IFsuLi5uZXcgU2V0KGEpXS5sZW5ndGgpIHtcbiAgICByZXR1cm4gZmFsc2U7XG4gIH1cblxuICBjb25zdCBoYXNoTWFwID0ge307XG4gIFxuICBiLmZvckVhY2goKGl0ZW0sIGluZGV4KSA9PiBoYXNoTWFwW2l0ZW1dID0gaW5kZXgpO1xuICBcbiAgcmV0dXJuIGEuZXZlcnkoKGl0ZW0pID0%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)\r\n\r\nI also updated the documentation and added new example cases.\r\n",
